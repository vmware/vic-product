# Configuring Registries #

A user can register himself/herself in vSphere Integrated Containers Registry in local user management (Database) mode. You can disable user self-registration. When self-registration is disabled, only the system administrator can add users in vSphere Integrated Containers Registry.  


## LDAP Authentication ## 

The auth_mode can only be switched when there is no user (except for admin) and no project (except for library) in the database. This instance already has quite a few users ( in database mode), switching to LDAP will cause user management issues. Therefore ldap_mode has been disabled.

So our document should describe that the users must choose LDAP mode at the first login of Harbor. After theyâ€™ve created some projects or users, they no longer have the option to switch to LDAP mode.

When an LDAP/AD user logs in by *username* and *password*, vSphere Integrated Containers Registry binds to the LDAP/AD server with the **"LDAP Search DN"** and **"LDAP Search Password"** described in [installation guide](installation_guide_ova.md). If it successes, vSphere Integrated Containers Registry looks up the user under the LDAP entry **"LDAP Base DN"** including substree. The attribute (such as uid, cn) specified by **"LDAP UID"** is used to match a user with the *username*. If a match is found, the user's *password* is verified by a bind request to the LDAP/AD server.  
	
Self-registration, changing password and resetting password are not supported anymore under LDAP/AD authentication mode because the users are managed by LDAP or AD.
