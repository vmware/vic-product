# Manage Replication Endpoints and Rules #

You can list, add, edit and delete replication endpoints and replication rules, depending on certain circumstances. 

- You cannot edit or delete replication endpoints that are the targets for replication rules. 
- You cannot edit replication rules that are enabled. 
- You cannot delete replication rules that have running jobs. If a rule is disabled, the running jobs under it will be stopped. 

**Prerequisites**

- You deployed at least two instances of vSphere Integrated Containers Registry. 
- You created at least one replication endpoint.
- You created at least one replication rule.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the vSphere Integrated Containers Registry instance to use as the source registry for replications. 

   Log in at https://<i>vic_appliance_address</i>:8282.  Use an account with vCenter Server administrator privileges. If the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance uses a different port for vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal, replace 8282 with the appropriate port.
2. Select the **Administration** tab, click **Replication**

   Existing endpoints appear in the **Endpoints** view.  
3. To edit or delete an endpoint, click the 3 vertical dots next to an endpoint name and select **Edit** or **Delete**.
4. To edit, enable or disable, or delete a replication rule, click **Replication Rule**, then click the 3 vertical dots next to a rule name and select **Edit**, **Enable** or **Disable**, or **Delete**.


**Result**

- If you enabled a rule, replication starts immediately. 
- If you disabled a rule, vSphere Integrated Containers Registry attempts to stop all running jobs. It can take some time for all jobs to finish.
