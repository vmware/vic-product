# Create a Project in vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal #

In vSphere Integrated Containers, you create different projects to which you assign users, repositories, and infrastructure. You also set up replication of registries in projects, and configure project-specific settings. When you first deploy vSphere Integrated Containers, a default public project named default-project is created. 

**Prerequisites**

Log in to vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal with a vSphere administrator or Management Portal administrator account. For information about logging in to vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal, see [Logging In to the Management Portal](logging_in_mp.md).

**Procedure**

1. Navigate to **Administration** > **Projects** and click **+Project**.
3. Provide a name for the project.
4. (Optional) Check the **Public** check box to make the project public.

   If you set the project to **Public**, any user can pull images from this project. If you leave the project set to **Private**, only users who are members of the project can pull images. You can toggle projects from public to private, or the reverse, at any moment after you create the project.
5. Click **Save**.

**Result**

The project is added to the list of projects. You can browse existing projects and filter the list by entering text in the search box.
