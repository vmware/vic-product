# Access and Search Project Logs #

vSphere Integrated Containers keeps a log of all of the operations that users perform in a project. You can apply filters to help you to search the logs.

**Prerequisites**

- Log in to vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal with a vSphere administrator or Cloud administrator account. For information about logging in to vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal, see [Logging In to the Management Portal](logging_in_mp.md).
- You have a created project.

**Procedure**

1. Select the **Administration** tab and click **Logs**.

    In the Logs view you can see system logs as well as logs of the vSphere Integrated Containers Registry.
3. To see a reduced list of operations, enter text in the **Filter Logs** text box.

    For example, enter the name of a repository.
