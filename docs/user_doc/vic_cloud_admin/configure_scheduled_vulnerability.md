### Configure Scheduled Vulnerability Scan on All Images 

You can set daily vulnerability scan on all images or disable that functionality.

**Procedure**

1. Go to http://<i>vic_appliance_address</i>, click the link to **Go to the vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal**, and enter the vCenter Server Single Sign-On credentials.
7. Select **Administration** > **Configuration** and under **Vulnerability Scanning**, verify that the database was updated recently.
8. Optionally, change the default settings for the scheduled daily vulnerability scanning and click **Save**.

	You can schedule a full scan for all images once a day or disable the automated full scan.

1. (Optional) Click **Scan Now** to manually start a full scan for all images.

	You can start a manual scan only once in two hours as the procedure is resource intensive.

1. To verify the scan results, navigate to **Administration** > **Projects** > **Your_project** > **Repositories**, expand an image repository, and hover over the report under **vulnerability**.
