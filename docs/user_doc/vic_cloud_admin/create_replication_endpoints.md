# Create Replication Endpoints #

To replicate image repositories from one instance of vSphere Integrated Containers Registry to another, you first create replication endpoints. A replication endpoint is a remote registry to which you replicate the images that a project contains.

You can create replication endpoints independently of projects, or you can create new endpoints when you create replication rule for a project. This procedure describes how to create endpoints independently of projects.

**Prerequisites**

- Log in to vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal with a vSphere administrator or Cloud administrator account. For information about logging in to vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal, see [Logging In to the Management Portal](logging_in_mp.md).
- You deployed at least two instances of vSphere Integrated Containers Registry. 

**Procedure**

1. Select the **Administration** tab, click **Global Registries** > **Replication Endpoints** and click the **+ New Endpoint** button.
3. Enter a suitable name for the new replication endpoint.
4. Enter the full URL of the vSphere Integrated Containers Registry instance to set up as a replication endpoint.

    For example, https://<i>registry_address</i>:443.

5. Enter the user name and password for the endpoint registry instance. 

    Use an account with Administrator privileges on that instance, or an account that has write permission on the corresponding project in the endpoint registry. 
6. Optionally, select the **Verify Remote Cert** check box.

    Deselect if the remote registry uses a self-signed or untrusted certificate. 
6. Click **Test Connection**.
7. When you have successfully tested the connection, click **OK**.

**Result**

The endpoint registry that you created is available for selection when you create replication rules for projects.

**What to Do Next**

Create a replication rule for a project.
