# Manage Projects # 

After you have created a project, you can toggle the project between the public and private states. When you no longer require a project, you can delete it.

**Prerequisites**

You have a created project.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the vSphere Integrated Containers Registry interface at https://<i>vic_appliance_address</i>:443.

   Use the `admin` account, an account with the system-wide Administrator role, or an account that has the Project Admin role for this project. If the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance uses a different port for vSphere Integrated Containers Registry, replace 443 with the appropriate port.
2. Click **Projects** on the left.
7. In the list of projects, click the 3 vertical dots next to a project name and select an option.

   - If the project is public, select **Make private** to change the project state to private.
   - If the project is private, select **Make public** to change the project state to public.
   - To delete the project, select **Delete**.
