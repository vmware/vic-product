# Initial Configuration of the Management Portal #

You must prepare the vSphere Integrated Container Management Portal and Registry for use, before you create your first projects and add more users.

The members of the vSphere Administrators group are the default Cloud administrators that can log in, configure the management portal, and add new Cloud administrators.
