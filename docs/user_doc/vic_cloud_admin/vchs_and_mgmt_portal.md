# Add VCHs in vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal #

You can provision containers, view live stats, and manage the hosts in your environment after you add existing Docker hosts or vSphere Integrated Containers virtual container hosts (VCHs) to projects. You can add the same VCH to multiple projects.

You add VCHs to projects according to the security flavor that you deployed the host with.
