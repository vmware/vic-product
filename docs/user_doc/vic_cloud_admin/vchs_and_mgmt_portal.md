# View and Manage VCHs in vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal #

You can view live stats and manage the hosts in your environment after you add your existing VCHs to the management portal. Connect each VCH by using an authentication method and protocol, per the security flavor that you deployed the host with.

- For hosts with no TLS authentication, connect over HTTP with no credentials.
- For hosts with only server-side TLS authentication, connect over HTTPS with no credentials.
- For hosts with full TLS authentication, connect over HTTPS by using a client certificate.
