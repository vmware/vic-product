## Vulnerability Scanning

vSphere Integrated Containers uses the open source project Clair to scan images for known vulnerabilities. Cloud administrators and DevOps administrators can set threshold values that restrict vulnerable images that exceed the threshold from being run on a per-project level. Once an image is uploaded into the registry, Clair checks the various layers of the image against known vulnerability databases and reports issues to the administrators.

**Prerequisites**

You must provide access from your vSphere Integrated Containers instance to the following URLs so that Clair can sync its database.
