# Using `dch-photon` to Build and Push Images

The current version of vSphere Integrated Containers Engine does not support `docker build` or `docker push`. As a consequence, the workflow for developing container images and pushing them to a registry server is slightly different to the workflow in a regular Docker environment.

- You use standard Docker to build, tag, and push a container image to a registry.
- You pull the image from the registry to a vSphere Integrated Containers virtual container host (VCH) to use it.

This release of vSphere Integrated Containers includes an image repository named `dch-photon`, that is pre-loaded in the `default-project` in vSphere Integrated Containers Registry. The `dch-photon` image allows you to deploy a standard Docker container host that runs in a Photon OS container. You can then use this Docker container host to perform `docker build` and `docker push` operations without having to install a local Docker host on your working machine.

**Prerequisites**

- Configure your Docker client to use the vSphere Integrated Containers Registry certificate. For information about how to obtain the registry certificate and pass it to the Docker client, see [Using vSphere Integrated Containers Registry](configure_docker_client.md#registry) in Configure the Docker Client for Use with vSphere Integrated Containers.
- You have access to a VCH that the vSphere administrator configured so that it can connect to the registry to pull the `dch-photon` image, and so that it has a default volume store. For information about how deploy a VCH for use with `dch-photon`, see the [Deploy a Virtual Container Host for Use with `dch-photon`](../vic_vsphere_admin/deploy_vch_dchphoton.md) in *Install, Deploy, and Maintain the vSphere Integrated Containers Infrastructure*.
- This topic provides an example of using `dch-photon` to push an image to vSphere Integrated Containers Registry and then pull it into a VCH. For simplicity, the example uses a VCH that was deployed with the `--no-tlsverify` option. If your VCH implements TLS verification of clients, you must import the VCH certificates into your Docker client and adapt the Docker commands accordingly. For information about how to connect a Docker client to a VCH that uses full TLS authentication, see [Connecting to the VCH](configure_docker_client.md#connectvch) in Configure the Docker Client for Use with vSphere Integrated Containers.  

**Procedure**

1. Log in to vSphere Integrated Containers Registry from the VCH.

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls login <i>registry_address</i></pre> 
2. Pull the `dch-photon` image from vSphere Integrated Containers Registry into your VCH.

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls pull <i>registry_address</i>/default-project/dch-photon:1.13</pre>

3. Run a `dch-photon` container from the image.

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls run --name dch-photon -d -p 12376:2376 <i>registry_address</i>/default-project/dch-photon:1.13 -tlsverify</pre>

    This command uses the following Docker options to run the `dch-photon` container:

    - `-d`, to run the `dch-photon` container in the background.
    - `-p` to map port 12376 on the VCH to the Docker TLS port 2376 on the `dch-photon` container
 
    This command also configures the Docker host that runs in the `dch-photon` container with the following option:

    <!-- `-tls`: Enables secure communication with no verification of the remote registry. Loads certificates from `/certs` as `/certs/docker.crt` as the server certificate and `/certs/docker.key` as the key for the server certificate.-->
    - `-tlsverify`: Verifies the client and server certificates for the connection from the Docker host running in the `dch-photon` container to the registry.
    <!-- - `-vic-ip`: Sets the IP address of the VCH for automatic certificate creation when `dch-photon` is running behind a port mapping.-->

4. Run `docker ps` on the VCH to see the status of the running `dch-photon` container.

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls ps</pre>

    In the output you see details of the port mapping from port 12376 on the VCH to port 2376/tcp on the `dch-photon` container.

4. Run `docker info` on the mapped port 12376 to obtain information about the Docker host running in the `dch-photon` container.

    Note that this command specifies port 12376, because you are running the command in the Docker host in the `dch-photon` container.

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:12376 --tls info</pre>

    In the output you see that this is a regular Docker 1.13.1 host.

6. Create the folder structure for the registry certificate in the `dch-photon` container. 

    The `dch-photon` container requires the CA certificate of the registry server. Note that these commands specify port 2376, because you are running them in the VCH.

    - First create a folder named `/etc/docker/certs.d`.<pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls exec dch-photon mkdir /etc/docker/certs.d</pre>
    - Then create a subfolder with the same name as the registry address, to contain the certificate.<pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls exec dch-photon mkdir /etc/docker/certs.d/<i>registry_address</i></pre>

7. Copy the CA certificate of the vSphere Integrated Containers Registry into the certificates folder in the `dch-photon` container. 

    Note that this command specifies port 2376.

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls cp <i>local_cert_path</i>/ca.crt dch-photon:/etc/docker/certs.d/<i>registry_address</i>/ca.crt</pre>

7. Restart the `dch-photon` container. 

    Restarting the container allows the Docker host that is running inside it to load the certificate.

    Note that this command specifies port 2376.

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls restart dch-photon</pre>

5. Create a simple `Dockerfile` and save it in the current directory.

    <pre>FROM debian:latest

    RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y fortune-mod fortunes

    ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/games/fortune", "-s"]</pre>

6. Build an image from the `Dockerfile` in the `dch-photon` Docker host, and tag it with the path to a project in vSphere Integrated Containers Registry. 

    Note that this command specifies port 12376.

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:12376 --tls build  -t <i>registry_address</i>/default-project/test-container .</pre>

8. Log in to vSphere Integrated Containers Registry from the `dch-photon` Docker host. 

    Note that this command specifies port 12376.

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:12376 --tls login <i>registry_address</i></pre>

6. Push the image from the `dch-photon` Docker host to the registry. 

    Note that this command specifies port 12376.

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:12376 --tls push <i>registry_address</i>/default-project/test-container</pre>

6. Pull the image from the registry into the VCH. 

    Note that this command specifies port 2376.

    <pre> docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls pull <i>registry_address</i>/default-project/test-container</pre>

6. Run a container from this image on the VCH. 

    <pre> docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls run <i>registry_address</i>/default-project/test-container</pre>

6. List the containers that are running in the VCH. 

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls ps</pre>

**Result**

The container that you ran from an image that you built and pushed to vSphere Integrated Containers Registry in `dch-photon` appears in the list of containers that are running in this VCH.
