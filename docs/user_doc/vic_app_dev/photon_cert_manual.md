## Manually Add the Registry Certificate to a `dch-photon` Container VM ##

To manually add the vSphere Integrated Containers CA certificate to  `dch-photon`, you can create a `dch-photon` container VM, then use `docker cp` to copy the certificate into it. 

**NOTE**: This method requires you to copy the certificate to every `dch-photon` container VM that you deploy. To avoid having to copy the certificate every time, the recommended method is to create a custom `dch-photon` image. For information about creating a custom image, see [Add the Registry Certificate to a Custom `dch-photon` Image](photon_cert_custom.html).

**Prerequisites**

- You have a known user account that has at least the Developer role in the `default-project` in vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal.
- You have an instance of Docker Engine running on your local sytem.
- You installed the CA certificate for vSphere Integrated Containers Registry in your local Docker client. For information about how to install the registry certificate in a Docker client, see [Install the  vSphere Integrated Containers Registry Certificate](configure_docker_client.md#registry).
- You have access to a virtual container host (VCH) that the vSphere administrator configured so that it can connect to the registry to pull the `dch-photon` image. The VCH must also have a volume store named `default`. For information about how deploy a VCH that is suitable for use with `dch-photon`, see the [Deploy a Virtual Container Host with a Volume Store and vSphere Integrated Containers Registry Access](../vic_vsphere_admin/deploy_vch_dchphoton.md) in *vSphere Integrated Containers for vSphere Administrators*. 
- For simplicity, this example uses a VCH that was deployed with the `--no-tlsverify` option. If your VCH implements TLS verification of clients, you must import the VCH certificates into your Docker client and adapt the Docker commands accordingly. For information about how to connect a Docker client to a VCH that uses full TLS authentication, see [Connecting to the VCH](configure_docker_client.md#connectvch) in Configure the Docker Client for Use with vSphere Integrated Containers.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to vSphere Integrated Containers Registry from your VCH.

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls login <i>registry_address</i></pre> 

5. Pull the `dch-photon` image into the image cache in your VCH.

    vSphere Integrated Containers 1.5.x supports `dch-photon` version 17.06.

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls pull <i>registry_address</i>/default-project/dch-photon:17.06</pre> 

1. Create a `dch-photon` container VM named `build-slave` in your VCH, but do not start it. 

    vSphere Integrated Containers 1.5.x supports `dch-photon` version 17.06.

    The container should be stopped because the Docker Engine instance that it runs must restart so that it can recognize the new certificate after you have copied it to the container. If you have already deployed `dch-photon`, use `docker stop` to stop it. 

    This example runs `dch-photon` behind a port mapping, that exposes the HTTP port (2375) of the `dch-photon` instance on port 12375 of the VCH.

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls create --name build-slave -p 12375:2375 <i>registry_address</i>/default-project/dch-photon:17.06</pre>
    
2. Create the required folder structure on your local machine.

    <pre>mkdir -p certs.d/<i>registry_address</i></pre>

3. Copy the certificate into the new folder.<pre>cp <i>path_to_cert</i>/ca.crt certs.d/<i>registry_address</i></pre> 
4. Use `docker cp` to copy the certificate from your local system into the `dch-photon` container VM named `build-slave` that is running in the VCH.

    Docker Engine stores registry certificates in a folder named <code>/etc/docker/certs.d/<i>registry_address</i></code>.<pre>
    docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376  --tls cp certs.d build-slave:/etc/docker</pre>
    
3. Restart the Docker host to load the certificate.

    <pre>docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls start build-slave</pre>
    
**Result**

You have a running Docker host named `build-slave`, that is exposed on port 12375 of your VCH. You configured `build-slave` to push and pull images to and from vSphere Integrated Containers Registry.

**What to Do Next**

To test the Docker host, see [Build, Push, and Pull an Image with `dch-photon`](test_photon.md).
