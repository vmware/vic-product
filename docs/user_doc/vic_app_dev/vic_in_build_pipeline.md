# Integrating vSphere Integrated Containers Engine into a Continuous Integration Pipeline #

vSphere Integrated Containers Engine is designed to exist at the end of a CI pipeline - as a test and production endpoint for deploying containerized applications.

However, vSphere Integrated Containers Engine is itself capable of deploying multiple components of a CI pipeline including build and test environments, Linux container hosts and development environments.

[TBD add examples]
