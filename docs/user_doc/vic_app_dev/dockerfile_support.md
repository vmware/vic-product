# Supported Dockerfile Instructions #

Some Dockerfile instructions are directives to the build process and a subset of them are directives to the container engine when a container is run. The latter is an important consideration when it comes to putting a Docker image into production.

For more information on Dockerfile instructions, see the [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder) here.

This topic provides information about which of the runtime Dockerfile instructions that vSphere Integrated Containers Engine 1.2 supports.
