# Developing Applications with vSphere Integrated Containers

*Developing Container Applications with vSphere Integrated Containers* provides information about how to use VMware vSphere&reg; Integrated Containers&trade; virtual container hosts (VCHs) as the endpoints for Docker container application development.

**Product version: 1.4**

This documentation applies to all 1.4.x releases.

## Intended Audience

This information is intended for container application developers whose development environment uses vSphere Integrated Containers. Knowledge of [container technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is assumed.

In particular, these topics explain how developing with vSphere Integrated Containers differs from development in a regular Docker environment, and often enhances it.
