# Using the `vic-machine` CLI Utility #

After you deploy the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance, you download the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine bundle from the appliance and unpack it on your usual working machine. For information about how to download the bundle, see [Download the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Bundle](vic_engine_bundle.md). 

The vSphere Integrated Containers Engine bundle includes the `vic-machine` CLI utility. You use `vic-machine` to deploy and manage virtual container hosts (VCHs) at the command line.
