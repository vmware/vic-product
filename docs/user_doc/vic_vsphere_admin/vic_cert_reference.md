# vSphere Integrated Containers Certificate Reference #

vSphere Integrated Containers authenticates connections to its various components by using TLS certificates. In some cases, the certificates are always automatically generated and self-signed. In other cases, you have the option of providing custom certificates.

This topic provides a reference of all of the certificates that vSphere Integrated Containers uses.
