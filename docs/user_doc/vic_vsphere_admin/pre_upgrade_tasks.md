# Tasks to Perform Before Upgrading the vSphere Integrated Containers Appliance #

To ensure a successful upgrade, you must perform several tasks before upgrading the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance. These pre-upgrade tasks are necessary due to differences in implementation between versions 1.1 and 1.2 of the vSphere Integrated Containers Registry and Management Portal, in particular the merging of the user interfaces and the transition to the Platform Services Controller for identity management.

- Make sure that the previous version of the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance allows SSH connections.

  1. Select the appliance VM in the Hosts and Clusters view of the vSphere client
  2. Select **Edit Settings** > **vApp Options**.
  3. Expand **Appliance Security** and make sure that **Permit Root Login** is set to `True`.
  4. If **Permit Root Login** is set to `False`, power off the appliance VM, and edit the settings to enable it.
- If the previous version of vSphere Integrated Containers Registry uses local database authentication for identity management, make a record of all of the users that exist in the database. These users cannot migrate to the Platform Services Controller, so you must recreate them after the upgrade.
- If the previous version of vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal includes projects in **Management** > **Policies** > **Placements**, project names must respect certain rules for the upgrade to succeed. Project names can only include the following characters:

   - Alpha-numeric characters 
   - Lower-case letters
   - Periods, dashes, and underscores
   - Maximum length of 254 characters 
   
    If project names include upper-case characters or special characters other than periods, dashes, and underscores, or exceed 254 characters, you must edit them before you perform the upgrade. 
- Ensure that all vCenter Server instances and ESXi hosts in the environment in which you are deploying the appliance have network time protocol (NTP) running. Running NTP prevents problems arising from clock skew between the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance, virtual container hosts, and the vSphere infrastructure.
- Back up the appliance by using your usual backup tools.
