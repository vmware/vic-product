# Deploy a VCH to a Basic vCenter Server Cluster

This topic provides instructions for deploying a virtual container host (VCH) in a very basic vCenter Server environment. This basic deployment allows you to test vSphere Integrated Containers Engine with vCenter Server before attempting a more complex deployment that corresponds to your real vSphere environment.

The vCenter Server instance to which you deploy the VCH must match the specifications listed in the prerequisites. This example deploys a VCH by using the minimum `vic-machine create` options possible, for demonstration purposes.

**Prerequisites**

* Deploy the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance. For information about deploying the appliance, see [Deploy the vSphere Integrated Containers Appliance](deploy_vic_appliance.md).
* In a Web browser, go to  http://<i>vic_appliance_address</i>, scroll down to Infrastructure Deployment Tools, click the link to **download the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine bundle**, and unpack it on your working machine.  
* Create or obtain a vCenter Server instance with the following configuration:
  * One datacenter
  * One cluster with two ESXi hosts and DRS enabled. You can use nested ESXi hosts for this example.
  * A shared datastore, that is accessible by both of the ESXi hosts.
  * The VM Network is present
  * One VMware vSphere Distributed Switch with one port group named `vic-bridge`
* Verify that your vCenter Server instance and both of the ESXi hosts in the cluster meet the requirements in [Environment Prerequisites for VCH Deployment](vic_installation_prereqs.md).
* Make sure that the correct firewall ports are open on the ESXi hosts. For information about how to open ports on ESXi hosts, see [Open the Required Ports on ESXi Hosts](open_ports_on_hosts.md).
* Obtain the vCenter Server certificate thumbprint. For information about how to obtain the certificate thumbprint, see [Obtain vSphere Certificate Thumbprints](obtain_thumbprint.md).
* Familiarize yourself with the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine binaries, as described in [Contents of the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Binaries](contents_of_vic_binaries.md). 
* Familiarize yourself with the basic options of the `vic-machine create` command described in [VCH Placement](vch_placement.md).
* Familiarize yourself with the bridge network and image store, as described in [Configure Bridge Networks](bridge_network.md) and [Specify the Image Store](image_store.md).
 

**Procedure**

1. Open a terminal on the system on which you downloaded and unpacked the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine binary bundle.
2. Navigate to the directory that contains the `vic-machine` utility:
3. Run the `vic-machine create` command.

   In these examples, the user name is wrapped in quotes because it contains `@`.

   - Linux OS:
      <pre>$ vic-machine-linux create
     --target <i>vcenter_server_address</i>
     --user 'Administrator@vsphere.local'
     --password <i>vcenter_server_password</i>
     --bridge-network vic-bridge
     --image-store <i>shared_datastore_name</i>
     --no-tlsverify
     --thumbprint <i>vcenter_server_certificate_thumbprint</i>
     </pre>  
   - Windows:
      <pre>$ vic-machine-windows create
     --target <i>vcenter_server_address</i>
     --user "Administrator@vsphere.local"
     --password <i>vcenter_server_password</i>
     --bridge-network vic-bridge
     --image-store <i>shared_datastore_name</i>
     --no-tlsverify
     --thumbprint <i>vcenter_server_certificate_thumbprint</i>
     </pre> 
   - Mac OS:
       <pre>$ vic-machine-darwin create
     --target <i>vcenter_server_address</i>
     --user 'Administrator@vsphere.local'
     --password <i>vcenter_server_password</i>
     --bridge-network vic-bridge
     --image-store <i>shared_datastore_name</i>
     --no-tlsverify
     --thumbprint <i>vcenter_server_certificate_thumbprint</i>
     </pre> 

The `vic-machine create` command in this example specifies the minimum information required to deploy a VCH to vCenter Server:

- The address of the vCenter Server instance on which to deploy the VCH, in the `--target` option.  
- A vCenter Single Sign-On user and password for a vSphere administrator account, in the `--user` and `--password` options. 
- The port group named `vic-bridge`, for use as the container bridge network. 
- The name of the shared datastore to use as the image store, in which to store container images.
- Disables the verification of clients that connect to this VCH by specifying the `--no-tlsverify` option.
- Specifies the thumbprint of the vCenter Server host certificate by specifying the `--thumbprint` option.
   
Because the vCenter Server instance only has one datacenter and one cluster, and uses the VM Network network, `vic-machine create` automatically detects and uses these resources.

This example deploys a VCH with the default name `virtual-container-host`.

**Result**

At the end of a successful deployment, `vic-machine` displays information about the new VCH:
   
<pre>Initialization of appliance successful
VCH Admin Portal:
https://<i>vch_address</i>:2378
Published ports can be reached at:
<i>vch_address</i>
Docker environment variables:
DOCKER_HOST=<i>vch_address</i>:2376
Environment saved in virtual-container-host/virtual-container-host.env
Connect to docker:
docker -H <i>vch_address</i>:2376 --tls info
Installer completed successfully</pre>

**What to Do Next** 

To test your VCH, see [Verify the Deployment of a VCH](verify_vch_deployment.md).
