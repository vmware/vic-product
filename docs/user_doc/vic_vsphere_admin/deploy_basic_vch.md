# Deploy a Basic Virtual Container Host #

The following topics provide examples of deploying of a basic virtual container host (VCH) either directly on an ESXi host or to vCenter Server.

These examples deploy VCHs by using the minimum `vic-machine create` options possible, for demonstration purposes.

- [Deploy a VCH to an ESXi Host with No vCenter Server](deploy_vch_esxi.md)
- [Deploy a VCH to a Basic vCenter Server Cluster](deploy_vch_vcenter.md)
