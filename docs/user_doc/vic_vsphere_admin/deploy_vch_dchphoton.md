# Deploy a Virtual Container Host for Use with `dch-photon` #

This release of vSphere Integrated Containers includes an image repository named `dch-photon`, that is pre-loaded in the `default-project` in vSphere Integrated Containers Registry. The `dch-photon` image allows you to deploy a standard Docker engine that runs in a Photon OS container. You can then use this Docker engine to perform `docker build` or `docker push` operations.
