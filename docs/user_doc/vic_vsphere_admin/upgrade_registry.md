# Upgrade vSphere Integrated Containers Registry 0.5 to 1.2.x #

If you deployed version 0.5 of vSphere Integrated Containers Registry (Harbor) with vSphere Integrated Containers 1.0, you can upgrade your existing installation to version 1.2.x.

**Prerequisites**

- You have a vSphere Integrated Containers Registry 0.5 installation that you deployed by using the official OVA installer from vSphere Integrated Containers 1.0.
- Back up the previous appliance by using your usual backup tools.
- Deploy the new vSphere Integrated Containers 1.2 appliance by using the OVA installer. For information about using the OVA installer, see [Deploy the vSphere Integrated Containers Appliance](deploy_vic_appliance.md). 

   - Deploy the  1.2 appliance in a location in which it can access the VMDK files of the 0.5 appliance.
   - In the **Appliance Security** section of the **Customize template** page of the installer, do not disable SSH access to the 1.2 appliance.
   - In the **Registry Configuration** section of the installer, make sure that you provide the same passwords in the **Registry Admin Password** and **Database Password** as the 0.5 appliance uses. 
- Log in to a vSphere Web Client instance from which you can access both of the vSphere Integrated Containers Registry 0.5 and 1.2 vSphere Integrated Containers appliances. 
- If you use vSphere 6.5, log in to the Flex-based vSphere Web Client, not the HTML5 vSphere Client.
