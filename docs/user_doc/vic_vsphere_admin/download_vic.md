 * Download tagged open source software (OSS) versions of the vSphere Integrated Containers components that have been tested and released to the open source community, but that might not reflect the most up-to-date version of the code: 
   * [vSphere Integrated Containers Engine](https://github.com/vmware/vic/releases)
   * [vSphere Integrated Containers Registry](https://github.com/vmware/harbor/releases)
   * [vSphere Integrated Containers Portal](https://github.com/vmware/admiral/releases)
 * Download built [vSphere Integrated Containers Engine binaries](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/vic-engine-builds/). Builds usually happen after every successful merge into the source code. These builds have been minimally tested for integration.  You need a Google account to access these builds.

   * [vSphere Integrated Containers Engine](https://github.com/vmware/vic/blob/master/README.md#building)
