# View Individual VCH and Container Information in the vSphere Clients #

After you have installed the client plug-ins for vSphere Integrated Containers, you can find information about individual virtual container hosts (VCHs) and container VMs in the HTML5 vSphere Client or the Flex-based vSphere Web Client.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not use the vSphere Client to perform operations on virtual container hosts or container VMs. Specifically, using the vSphere Client to power off, power on, or delete the VCH vApp or VCH endpoint VM can cause vSphere Integrated Containers Engine to not function correctly. Always use `vic-machine` to perform operations on VCHs. The vSphere Client does not allow you to delete container VMs, but do not use the vSphere Client to power container VMs on or off. Always use Docker commands to perform operations on containers. 

**Prerequisites**

- You deployed a VCH and at least one container VM.
- You installed the plug-ins for vSphere Integrated Containers.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to either the HTML5 vSphere Client or the Flex-based vSphere Web Client.
2. On the **Home** page, select **Hosts and Clusters**.
2. Expand the hierarchy of vCenter Server objects to navigate to the VCH vApp.
3. Expand the VCH vApp and select the VCH endpoint VM.

    Information about the VCH appears in the **Virtual Container Host** portlet in the **Summary** tab:

    - The `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable that container developers use to connect to this VCH.
    - The link to the VCH Admin Portal for this VCH.

4. Select a container VM.

    Information about the container VM appears in the **Container** portlet in the **Summary** tab:
    - The name of the running container. If the container developer used <code>docker run -name <i>container_name</i></code> to run the container, <code><i>container_name</i></code> appears in the portlet.
    - The image from which the container was deployed.
    - If the container developer used <code>docker run -p <i>port</i></code> to map a port when running the container, the port number and the protocol appear in the portlet.
