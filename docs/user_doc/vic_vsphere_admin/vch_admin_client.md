# Virtual Container Host Administration in the vSphere Client #

vSphere Integrated Containers provides a plug-in for the HTML5 vSphere Client on vCenter Server 6.5 and 6.7. The HTML5 plug-in allows you to to deploy and interact with virtual container hosts (VCHs) directly in the vSphere Client.

vSphere Integrated Containers also provides a basic informational plug-in for the Flex-based vSphere Web Client on vCenter Server 6.0.  

**NOTE**: vSphere Integrated Containers 1.5.2 and later versions do not include the Flex-based vSphere Web Client.
