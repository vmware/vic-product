# Configure Bridge Networks #

Bridge networks are the network or networks that container VMs use to communicate with each other. Every virtual container host (VCH) must have a unique bridge network. In Docker terminology, the bridge network corresponds to the default bridge network on a Docker host. You can also create additional bridge networks, that correspond to Docker user-defined networks.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not use the bridge network for any other VM workloads, or as a bridge for more than one VCH.

Container application developers can use `docker network create` to create additional, user-defined bridge networks when they run containers. VCHs create additional user-defined bridge networks by using IP address segregation within an address range that you specify, so user-defined bridge networks do not require new port groups. 

- [`vic-machine` Options](#options)
- [Example `vic-machine` Command](#example)

## `vic-machine` Options <a id="options"></a>

You designate the bridge network by specifying the `vic-machine create --bridge-network` option. You can also provide a range of IP addresses for use by additional user-defined bridge networks by specifying the `bridge-network-range` option. For information about how to set bridge network ranges, see the section on the [ `--bridge-network-range` option](#bridge-range). 

### `--bridge-network` <a id="bridge"></a>

**Short name**: `-b`

A port group that container VMs use to communicate with each other. 

The `--bridge-network` option is **mandatory** if you are deploying a VCH to vCenter Server. Before you run `vic-machine create`, you must create a distributed virtual switch and a port group for the bridge network. You must add the target ESXi host or hosts to the distributed virtual switch, and assign a VLAN ID to the port group, to ensure that the bridge network is isolated. For information about how to create a distributed virtual switch and port group, see the section on Networking Requirements in [Environment Prerequisites for VCH Deployment](vic_installation_prereqs.md#networkreqs).

The `--bridge-network` option is **optional** if you are deploying a VCH to an ESXi host that is not managed by vCenter Server. In this case, if you do not specify `--bridge-network`, `vic-machine` creates a  virtual switch and a port group that each have the same name as the VCH. You can optionally specify this option to assign an existing port group for use as the bridge network for container VMs. You can also optionally specify this option to create a new virtual switch and port group that have a different name to the VCH.

**IMPORTANT** 

- Do not specify the same port group as the bridge network for multiple VCHs. Sharing a port group between VCHs might result in multiple container VMs being assigned the same IP address. 
- Do not use the bridge network port group as the target for any of the other `vic-machine create` networking options.
- If you intend to use the `--ops-user` option to use different user accounts for deployment and operation of the VCH, you must place the bridge network port group in a network folder that has the `Read-Only` role with propagation enabled. For more information about the requirements when using `--ops-user`, see [Use Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation](set_up_ops_user.md).

**Usage**: 
<pre>--bridge-network <i>port_group_name</i></pre>

If you do not specify `--bridge-network` or if you specify an invalid port group name, `vic-machine create` fails and suggests valid port groups. 

### `--bridge-network-range` <a id="bridge-range"></a>

**Short name**: `--bnr`

A range of IP addresses that additional bridge networks can use when container application developers use `docker network create` to create new bridge networks. 

When you specify the bridge network IP range, you specify the IP range as a CIDR. The smallest subnet that you can specify is /16. 

**Usage**: 
<pre>--bridge-network-range <i>network_address</i>/<i>subnet</i></pre>

If you do not specify the `bridge-network-range` option, the IP range for bridge networks is 172.16.0.0/12. If you specify an invalid value for `--bridge-network-range`, `vic-machine create` fails with an error.

## Example `vic-machine` Command <a id="example"></a>

This example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:

- Specifies the target vCenter Server instance, the vCenter Server user name, password, datacenter and cluster, an image store, a name for the VCH, and the thumbprint of the vCenter Server certificate.
- Secures connections to the Docker API with an automatically generated server certificate, without client certificate verification, by setting `--no-tlsverify`.
- Designates an existing port group named `vch1-bridge` as the bridge network.
- Designates IP addresses in the range 192.168.100.0/16 for use by user-defined bridge networks.

<pre>vic-machine-<i>operating_system</i> create
--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':<i>password</i>@<i>vcenter_server_address</i>/dc1
