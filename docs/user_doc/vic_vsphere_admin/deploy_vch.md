# Deploy Virtual Container Hosts with `vic-machine` #

After you deploy the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance, go to  http://<i>vic_appliance_address</i> in a Web browser, scroll down to Infrastructure Deployment Tools, click the link to **download the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine bundle**, and unpack it on your working machine.

The vSphere Integrated Containers Engine binaries include the `vic-machine` utility, that you use to deploy virtual container hosts (VCHs). For a description of the role and function of VCHs, see [vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Concepts](../vic_overview/introduction.md#concepts) in *Overview of vSphere Integrated Containers*.
