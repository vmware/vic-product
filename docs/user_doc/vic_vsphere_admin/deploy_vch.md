# Using `vic-machine` to Deploy Virtual Container Hosts #

After you deploy the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance, you can download the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine binaries, `vic_1.2.x-version.tar.gz`, from https://<i>vic_appliance_address</i>:9443. The vSphere Integrated Containers Engine binaries include the `vic-machine` utility, that you use to deploy virtual container hosts (VCHs).
