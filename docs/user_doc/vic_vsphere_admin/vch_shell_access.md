# Enable shell access to the VCH Endpoint VM #

You can use the `vic-machine debug` command to enable shell access to a virtual container host (VCH) endpoint VM by setting a root password on the VM. Setting a root password enables access to the VCH endpoint VM via the VM console only. If you require SSH access to the VCH endoint VM, rather than just shell access, see [Authorize SSH Access to the VCH Endpoint VM](vch_ssh_access.md).  

**IMPORTANT**: Any changes that you make to a VCH by using `vic-machine debug` are non-persistent and are discarded if the VCH endpoint VM reboots.

In addition to the [Common `vic-machine` Options](common_vic_options.md), `vic-machine debug` provides the `--rootpw`, `--enable-ssh` and `--authorized-key` options.

- You must specify the vSphere target and its credentials, either in the `--target` option or separately in the `--user` and `--password` options. 
      
    The credentials that you provide must have the following privilege on the endpoint VM:<pre>Virtual machine.Guest Operations.Guest Operation Program Execution</pre>

- You must specify the ID or name of the VCH to debug.
- You might need to provide the thumbprint of the vCenter Server or ESXi host certificate. Use upper-case letters and colon delimitation in the thumbprint. Do not use space delimitation.
- You enable shell access by specifying a password for the root user on the VCH endpoint VM in the `--rootpw` option. Setting a password on the VCH allows you to access the VCH by using the VM console. If you also set the `--enable-ssh` option, you can use this password to connect to the VCH by using SSH. Wrap the password in quotes if it includes shell characters such as `$`, `!` or `%`. <pre>--rootpw '<i>new_p@ssword</i>'</pre>
- When you use the password to log in to a VCH, you see the message that the password will expire in 0 days. To obtain a longer expiration period, use the Linux `passwd` command in the endpoint VM to set a new password. If the password expires, the VCH does not revert to the default security configuration from before you ran `vic-machine debug`. If you attempt to log in using an interactive password via the terminal or SSH, you see a prompt to change the password. If you are using an SSH key, you cannot log in until you either change the password or run `vic-machine debug` again.


## Example ##

This example sets a password to allow shell access to the VCH.<pre>$ vic-machine-<i>operating_system</i> debug
     --target <i>vcenter_server_or_esxi_host_address</i>
     --user <i>vcenter_server_or_esxi_host_username</i>
     --password <i>vcenter_server_or_esxi_host_password</i>
     --id <i>vch_id</i>
     --thumbprint <i>certificate_thumbprint</i>
     --rootpw '<i>new_p@ssword</i>' </pre>

### Output

The output of the `vic-machine debug` command includes confirmation that SSH access is enabled:

<pre>### Configuring VCH for debug ####
[...]
SSH to appliance:
ssh root@<i>vch_address</i>
[...]
Completed successfully</pre>
