# Manually Upgrade the vSphere Client Plug-Ins #

If you upgraded to vSphere Integrated Containers 1.4.3 or later and you used the option to automatically upgrade the vSphere Integrated Containers plug-ins for the vSphere Client, you do not need to perform any further action. The plug-ins are upgraded during the upgrade of the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance.

If you upgraded to a version of vSphere Integrated Containers that pre-dates 1.4.3, you must upgrade them manually.

- [Manually Upgrade the vSphere Client Plug-Ins on a vCenter Server Appliance](upgrade_h5_plugin_vcsa.md)

**NOTE**: If you upgraded to vSphere Integrated Containers 1.4.3 or later and you did not use the option to upgrade the plug-ins, you can  upgrade the plug-ins later by reinitializing the appliance. For information, see [Reinitialize the vSphere Integrated Containers Appliance](reinitialize_appliance.md).
