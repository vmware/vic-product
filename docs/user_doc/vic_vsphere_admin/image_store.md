# Specify the Image Store #

### `--image-store` <a id="image"></a>

Short name: `-i`

The datastore in which to store container image files, container VM files, and the files for the VCH. The `--image-store` option is **mandatory** if there is more than one datastore in your vSphere environment. If there is only one datastore in your vSphere environment, the `--image-store` option is not required. 

If you do not specify the `--image-store` option and multiple possible datastores exist, or if you specify an invalid datastore name, `vic-machine create` fails and suggests valid datastores in the failure message. 

If you are deploying the VCH to a vCenter Server cluster, the datastore that you designate in the `image-store` option must be shared by at least two ESXi hosts in the cluster. Using non-shared datastores is possible, but limits the use of vSphere features such as vSphere vMotion&reg; and VMware vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler&trade; (DRS).

To specify a whole datastore as the image store, specify the datastore name in the `--image-store` option:

<pre>--image-store <i>datastore_name</i></pre>

If you designate a whole datastore as the image store, `vic-machine` creates the following set of folders in the target datastore: 

-  <code><i>datastore_name</i>/VIC/<i>vch_uuid</i>/images</code>, in which to store all of the container images that you pull into the VCH.
- <code><i>datastore_name</i>/<i>vch_name</i></code>, that contains the VM files for the VCH.
- <code><i>datastore_name</i>/<i>vch_name</i>/kvstores</code>, a key-value store folder for the VCH.

You can specify a datastore folder to use as the image store by specifying a path in the `--image-store` option</code>: 

<pre>--image-store <i>datastore_name</i>/<i>path</i></pre> 

If the folder that you specify in `/path` does not already exist, `vic-machine create` creates it.

If you designate a datastore folder as the image store, `vic-machine` creates the following set of folders in the target datastore:

- <code><i>datastore_name</i>/<i>path</i>/VIC/<i>vcu_uuid</i>/images</code>, in which to store all of the container images that you pull into the VCH. 
- <code><i>datastore_name</i>/<i>vch_name</i></code>, that contains the VM files for the VCH. This is the same as if you specified a datastore as the image store.
- <code><i>datastore_name</i>/<i>vch_name</i>/kvstores</code>, a key-value store folder for the VCH. This is the same as if you specified a datastore as the image store.

By specifying the path to a datastore folder in the `--image-store` option, you can designate the same datastore folder as the image store for multiple VCHs. In this way, `vic-machine create` creates only one `VIC` folder in the datastore, at the path that you specify. The `VIC` folder contains one <code><i>vch_uuid</i>/images</code> folder for each VCH that you deploy. By creating one <code><i>vch_uuid</i>/images</code> folder for each VCH, vSphere Integrated Containers Engine limits the potential for conflicts of image use between VCHs, even if you share the same image store folder between multiple hosts.

When container developers create containers, vSphere Integrated Containers Engine stores the files for container VMs at the top level of the image store, in folders that have the same name as the containers.
