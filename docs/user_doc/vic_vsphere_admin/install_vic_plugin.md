# Installing the vSphere Client Plug-Ins #

vSphere Integrated Containers provides a basic plug-in for the Flex-based vSphere Web Client on vCenter Server 6.0 or 6.5. vSphere Integrated Containers provides a plug-in with more complete functionality for the HTML5 vSphere Client. The HTML5 vSphere Client is only available with vSphere 6.5. 

You can deploy the plug-ins on a vCenter Server instance that runs on Windows, or on a vCenter Server Appliance.

For information about the Flex-based vSphere Web Client and the HTML5 vSphere Client for vSphere 6.5, see [Client Interfaces for vSphere](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-6710A6C4-00AE-4930-BBD6-BDEF78029994.html) in the vSphere 6.5 documentation.
