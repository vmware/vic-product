# Troubleshoot vSphere Client Plug-In Installation

This section provides solutions for common problems that you might encounter while installing the vSphere Integrated Containers plug-in for the vSphere Client.

**IMPORTANT**: If you use vSphere 6.7 update 1 or later, you must use vSphere Integrated Containers 1.4.3 or later. Due to significant changes in the HTML5 vSphere Client in version 6.7 update 1, previous versions of the vSphere Integrated Containers plug-in for the vSphere Client might not work with that version. Only version 1.4.3 and later releases have been verified with vSphere 6.7 update 1.
