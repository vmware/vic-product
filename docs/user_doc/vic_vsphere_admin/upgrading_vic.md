# Upgrading vSphere Integrated Containers #

If you have an existing deployment of vSphere Integrated Containers 1.0, you can upgrade its components to version 1.1.

-  You can upgrade vSphere Integrated Containers Registry from version 0.5 to version 1.1.
-  To upgrade vSphere Integrated Containers Engine from 0.8 or later to 1.1, upgrade your virtual container hosts (VCHs) individually.
-  There is no upgrade for the Flex-based vSphere Web Client plug-in for vSphere Integrated Containers 1.0. Use the plug-in for the HTML5 vSphere Client, which is new in 1.1. 

vSphere Integrated Containers 1.0 did not officially support vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal. You cannot upgrade an existing instance of vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal to version 1.1.
