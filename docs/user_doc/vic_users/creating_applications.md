# Creating Applications #

Applications are comprised of multiple containers. When you create an application, you create a template that leverages multiple containers, shares storage, and enables them to communicate between each other. 

**Procedure**

1. In the management portal, navigate to **Deployments** > **Applications** and click **+Application**.
2. On the Create a Template page, enter the application name and click **Proceed**. 
   
**Result**

An application template with the name you specify is created and the Edit Template page is displayed. You can now configure your application template.

For more information about the configuration tasks you can perform on templates, see [Template Configuration Tasks](template_tasks.md)

After you configure the application, you can view details, start, stop, or remove the application by clicking on the respective icons on the application.
