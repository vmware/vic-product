# Adding Container Hosts #

As a Management Portal administrator, you can add existing Docker hosts or vSphere Integrated Containers virtual container hosts (VCHs) to projects. After adding the hosts, you can provision containers, view live stats and manage the hosts in the Management Portal.

You must only add a given VCH to one project at a time. Adding the same VCH to multiple projects can lead to conflicts if the registry lists and content trust setttings are different in the different projects.

For more information about adding container hosts, see [Add Container Hosts to Projects](../vic_cloud_admin/vchs_and_mgmt_portal.md)
