# Creating Templates and Applications #

You can use templates to provision individual container VMs and multi-container application deployments in the management portal. 

To provision a container VM, you can save the configration of the container VM as a template so that you can provision identical container VMs when you require.

For information about creating a template see, [Provisioning Container VMs](provision_containers_portal.md).

Applications are comprised of multiple containers. When you create an application, you create a template that leverages multiple containers and enables them to communicate between each other. 

You can perform the following operations on applications:

- Associating a container with the template.
- Associating a volume to the template. You can add an existing volume or create a new one.
- Associating a network to the template. You can add an existing network or create a new one.
- Adding links, scale, etc.
- Drag and associate network/volume with the container.
- Export/import templates
- Delete template
