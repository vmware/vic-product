# vSphere Integrated Containers Documentation #

- The contents of `/setup/beta` are old docs that can probably be deleted.
- The contents of `user_doc` are the Markdown source files for the official vSphere Integrated Containers docs. These docs are published in a built, navigable, and searchable form at https://vmware.github.io/vic-product/index.html#getting-started.
