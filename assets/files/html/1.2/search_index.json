When understanding containers and how they relate to vSphere Integrated Containers, it is helpful to distinguish the runtime aspect of containers from the packaging aspect.\nContainer Runtime \nAt its most basic, a container is simply a sandbox in which a process can run. The sandbox isolates the process from other processes that are running on the same system. A container has a lifecycle which is typically tied to the lifecycle of the process that it is designed to run. If you start a container, it starts its main process and when that process ends, the container stops. The container might have access to some storage. It typically has an identity on a network.\nConceptually, a container represents many of the same capabilities as a VM. The main difference between the two is the abstraction layer:\n\nA software container is a sandbox within a guest OS and it is up to the guest to provide the container with its dependencies and to enforce isolation. Multiple containers share the guest kernel, networking, and storage. A container does not boot. It is simply a slice of an already-running OS. The OS running the container is called its host.\n\nIn contrast, a VM is a sandbox within a hypervisor. It is the hypervisor that provides a VM with its dependencies, such as virtual disks and NICs. A VM has to boot an OS and its lifecycle is typically tied to that of the OS rather than to that of any one process. By design, a VM is strongly isolated from other VMs and its host.\n\n\nOne of the most interesting facets of containers is how they deal with state. Any data that a container writes is non-persistent by default and is lost when that container is deleted. State, however, can persist beyond the lifespan of a container by attaching a volume to it or by sending it over a network. Binary dependencies that the container needs, such as OS libraries or application binaries, are encapsulated in images. Images are immutable.\nContainer Packaging \nOne of the most significant benefits of containers is that they allow you to package up the entire environment that an application needs and run it anywhere. You can go to Docker Hub, select from hundreds of thousands of applications and run that application anywhere that you have installed Docker on a compatible OS. The packaging encapsulates the binary dependencies, environment variables, volumes, and even the network configuration. \nThe format of this packaging is called an image. An image is a template from which many containers can instantiate. The Docker image format allows for images to be composed in a parent-child relationship, just like a disk snapshot. This image hierarchy allows containers to share common dependencies. For example, you might have a Debian 8 image that has a child image with Java installed. That Java image might have a child with Tomcat installed. The Debian 8 image might have other children, such as PHP, Python, and so on. \nThe immutability of the image format means that you never modify an image, you always create a new one. The layered nature of the image format means that you can cache commonly-used layers so that you only need to download or upload the layers that you do not already have. It also means that if you want to patch a particular image, you create a new image and then rebuild all of its children. \nThe main advantage of the image format is its portability. As long as you have a destination that is running a container engine, for example Docker, you can download and run an image on it. This portability is facilitated by a registry. A registry is a service that indexes and stores images. You can run your own private image registry that forms part of a development pipeline. You can push images to the registry from development, pull them into a test environment for verification, and then pull them into a production environment.\nWhat is vSphere Integrated Containers? \nvSphere Integrated Containers comprises three major components:\n\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine, a container runtime for vSphere that allows you to provision containers as virtual machines, offering the same security and functionality of virtual machines in VMware ESXi™ hosts or vCenter Server® instances. \nvSphere Integrated Containers Registry, an enterprise-class container registry server that stores and distributes container images. vSphere Integrated Containers Registry extends the Docker Distribution open source project by adding the functionalities that an enterprise requires, such as security, identity and management.\nvSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal, a container management portal that provides a UI for DevOps teams to provision and manage containers, including the ability to obtain statistics and information about container instances. Cloud administrators can manage container hosts and apply governance to their usage, including capacity quotas and approval workflows.\n\nThese components currently support the Docker image format. vSphere Integrated Containers is entirely Open Source and free to use. Support for vSphere Integrated Containers is included in the vSphere Enterprise Plus license.\nvSphere Integrated Containers is designed to solve many of the challenges associated with putting containerized applications into production. It directly uses the clustering, dynamic scheduling, and virtualized infrastructure in vSphere and bypasses the need to maintain discrete Linux VMs as container hosts.\nvSphere Integrated Containers allows you, the vSphere administrator, to provide a container management endpoint to a user as a service. At the same time, you remain in complete control over the infrastructure that the container management endpoint service depends on. The main differences between vSphere Integrated Containers and a classic container environment are the following:\n\nvSphere, not Linux, is the container host:\nContainers are deployed as VMs, not in VMs.\nEvery container is fully isolated from the host and from the other containers.\nvSphere provides per-tenant dynamic resource limits within a vCenter Server cluster\n\n\nvSphere, not Linux, is the infrastructure:\nYou can select vSphere networks that appear in the Docker client as container networks.\nImages, volumes, and container state are provisioned directly to VMFS.\n\n\nvSphere is the control plane:\nUse the Docker client to directly control selected elements of vSphere infrastructure.\nA container endpoint Service-as-a-Service presents as a service abstraction, not as IaaS.\n\n\n\nvSphere Integrated Containers is designed to be the fastest and easiest way to provision any Linux-based workload to vSphere, if that workload can be serialized as a Docker image.\nWhat Does vSphere Integrated Containers Do? \nvSphere Integrated Containers gives you, the vSphere administrator, the tools to easily make your vSphere infrastructure accessible to users so that they can provision container workloads into production.\nScenario 1: A Classic Container Environment\nIn a classic container environment: \n\nA user raises a ticket and says, \"I need Docker\". \nYou provision a large Linux VM and send them the IP address.\nThe user installs Docker, patches the OS, configures in-guest network and storage virtualization, secures the guest, isolates the containers, packages the containers efficiently, and manages upgrades and downtime. \n\nIn this scenario, what you have provided is similar to a nested hypervisor that they have to manage and which is opaque to you. If you scale that up to one large Linux VM per tenant, you end up creating a large distributed silo for containers.\nScenario 2: vSphere Integrated Containers\nWith vSphere Integrated Containers: \n\nA user raises a ticket and says, \"I need Docker\". \nYou identify datastores, networking, and compute on your cluster that the user can use for their Docker environment. \nYou use a utility called vic-machine to install a small appliance, called a virtual container host (VCH). The VCH represents an authorization to use the infrastructure that you have identified, into which the user can self-provision container workloads.\nThe appliance runs a secure remote Docker API, that is the only access that the user has to the vSphere infrastructure.\nInstead of sending your user a Linux VM, you send them the IP address of the appliance, the port of the remote Docker API, and a certificate for secure access.\n\nIn this scenario, you have provided the user with a service portal. This is better for the user because they do not have to worry about isolation, patching, security, backup, and so on. It is better for you because every container that the user deploys is a container VM. You can perform vMotion and monitor container VMs just like all of your other VMs.\nIf the user needs more compute capacity, in Scenario 1, the pragmatic choice is to power down the VM and reconfigure it, or give the user a new VM and let them deal with the clustering implications. Both of these solutions are disruptive to the user. With vSphere Integrated Containers in Scenario 2, you can reconfigure the VCH in vSphere, or redeploy it with a new configuration in a way that is completely transparent to the user.\nvSphere Integrated Containers allows you to select and dictate the appropriate infrastructure for the task in hand:\n\nNetworking: You can select multiple port groups for different types of network traffic, ensuring that all of the containers that a user provisions get the appropriate interfaces on the right networks.\nStorage: You can select different vSphere datastores for different types of state. For example, container state is ephemeral and is unlikely to need to be backed up, but volume state almost certainly should be backed up. vSphere Integrated Containers automatically ensures that state gets written to the appropriate datastore when the user provisions a container.\n\nTo summarize, vSphere Integrated Containers gives you a mechanism that allows users to self-provision VMs as containers into your virtual infrastructure.\nWhat is vSphere Integrated Containers Engine? \nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine currently offers a subset of the Docker API. It is designed to specifically address the provisioning of containers into production, solving many of the problems highlighted in What Does vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Do?.\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine exploits the portability of the Docker image format to present itself as an enterprise deployment target. Developers build containers on one system and push them to a registry. Containers are tested by another system and are approved for production. vSphere Integrated Containers Engine can then pull the containers out of the registry and deploy them to vSphere.\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine Concepts \nIf you consider a Venn diagram with \"What vSphere Does\" in one circle and \"What Docker Does\" in another, the overlap is significant. The objective of vSphere Integrated Containers Engine is to take as much of vSphere as possible and layer whatever Docker capabilities are missing on top, reusing as much of Docker's own code as possible. The  result should not sacrifice the portability of the Docker image format and should be completely transparent to a Docker client. The following sections describe key concepts and components that make this possible.\n\nContainer VMs \nThe container VMs that vSphere Integrated Containers Engine creates have all of the characteristics of software containers:\n\nAn ephemeral storage layer with optionally attached persistent volumes.\nA custom Linux guest OS that is designed to be \"just a kernel\" and that needs images to be functional.\nA mechanism for persisting and attaching read-only binary image layers.\nA PID 1 guest agent tether extends the control plane into the container VM.\nVarious well-defined methods of configuration and state ingress and egress\nAutomatically configured to various network topologies.\n\nThe provisioned container VM does not contain any OS container abstraction. \n\nThe container VM boots from an ISO that contains the Photon Linux kernel. Note that container VMs do not run the full Photon OS.\nThe container VM is configured with a container image that is mounted as a disk. \nContainer image layers are represented as a read-only VMDK snapshot hierarchy on a vSphere datastore. At the top of this hierarchy is a read-write snapshot that stores ephemeral state. \nContainer volumes are formatted VMDKs that are attached as disks and indexed on a datastore. \nNetworks are distributed port groups that are attached as vNICs.\n\nVirtual Container Hosts \nA virtual container host (VCH) is the functional equivalent of a Linux VM that runs Docker, but with some significant benefits. A VCH represents the following elements:\n\nA clustered pool of resource into which to provision container VMs.\nA single-tenant container namespace.\nAn isolated Docker API endpoint. \nAuthorization to use and configure pre-approved virtual infrastructure.\nA private network that containers are attached to by default.\n\nIf you deploy a VCH in a vCenter Server cluster, it spans all of the hosts in the cluster, providing the same flexibility and dynamic use of host resources as is the norm.\nA VCH is functionally distinct from a traditional container host in the following ways:\n\nIt naturally encapsulates clustering and dynamic scheduling by provisioning to vSphere targets.\nThe resource constraints are dynamically configurable with no impact on the containers.\nContainers do not share a kernel.\nThere is no local image cache. This is kept on a datastore in the cluster that you specify when you deploy a VCH. \nThere is no read-write shared storage\n\nA VCH is a multi-functional appliance that you deploy as a vApp in a vCenter Server cluster or as a resource pool on an ESXi host. The vApp or resource pool provides a useful visual parent-child relationship in the vSphere Client so that you can easily identify the container VMs that are provisioned into a VCH. You can also specify resource limits on the vApp. You can provision multiple VCHs onto a single ESXi host, into a vSphere resource pool, or into a vCenter Server cluster.\nThe VCH Endpoint VM \nThe VCH endoint VM is the VM that runs inside the VCH vApp or resource pool. There is a 1:1 relationship between a VCH and a VCH endpoint VM. The VCH endpoint VM provides the following functions:\n\nRuns the services that a VCH requires.\nProvides a secure remote API to a client.\nReceives Docker commands and translates those commands into vSphere API calls and vSphere infrastructure constructs.\nProvides network forwarding so that ports to containers can be opened on the VCH endoint VM and the containers can access a public network.\nManages the lifecycle of the containers, the image store, the volume store, and the container state\nProvides logging and monitoring of its own services and of its containers.\n\nThe lifecycle of the VCH endpoint VM is managed by a utility called vic-machine. \nThe vic-machine Utility \nThe vic-machine utility is a binary for Windows, Linux, and OSX that manages the lifecycle of VCHs. vic-machine has been designed for use by vSphere administrators. It takes pre-existing compute, network, storage and a vSphere user as input and creates a VCH as output. It has the following additional functions:\n\nCreates certificates for Docker client TLS authentication.\nChecks that the prerequisites for VCH deployment are met on the cluster or host, namely that the firewall, licenses, and so on are configured correctly.\nConfigures existing VCHs for debugging.\nLists, inspects, upgrades, and deletes VCHs.\n\nWhat Is vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal? \nvSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal is a highly scalable and very lightweight container management platform for deploying and managing container based applications. It is designed to have a small footprint and boot extremely quickly. vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal is intended to provide DevOps administrators with automated deployment and lifecycle management of containers.\n\nRule-based resource management, allowing DevOps administrators to set deployment preferences which let vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal manage container placement.\nLive state updates that provide a live view of the container system.\nMulti-container template management, that enables logical multi-container application deployments.\n\nFor more information about vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal, see View and Manage VCHs in vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal in Configure and Manage vSphere Integrated Containers.\nProjects and Role-Based Access Control \nIn vSphere Integrated Containers Registry, you organize repositories in projects. \"Repository\" is Docker terminology for a collection of container images that have the same name but that have different tags. You assign users to the projects and you assign roles with different permissions to the users in each project. There are two types of project in vSphere Integrated Containers Registry:  \n\nPublic projects: All users can pull images from the project. Users must be members of a project and have the appropriate privileges to push images to the project.\nPrivate projects: Only members of the project can pull images from private private projects. Members must have the appropriate privileges to be able to push images to the project.\n\nWhen you first deploy vSphere Integrated Containers Registry, a default public project named library is created. You can toggle projects from public to private, or the reverse, at any moment.\nUser Authentication \nvSphere Integrated Containers is fully integrated with VMware Platform Services Controller. The Platform Services Controller provides common infrastructure services to the vSphere environment. Services include licensing, certificate management, and authentication with vCenter Single Sign-On. With vCenter Single Sign-On you can use local users created in the Platform Services Controller or configure external identity sources. \nFor more information about, deploying, configuring, and working with Platform Services Controller, see the Platform Services Controller Administration Guide in the VMware vSphere documentation.\nYou can pull users from the Platform Services Controller and assign them roles through the vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal.\nUsers and Roles \nvSphere Integrated Containers features four roles for user access. The viewer role has the lowest level of access with the global administrator having the highest. Permissions per role are described below, as every next role inherits the permissions of the previous role and has additional ones.\nViewer\nRole assigned per project.\n\nIf assigned, has only view access to the deployed containers, templates, and available resources for a project.\n\nDeveloper\nRole assigned per project. In addition to the view access, a developer can also:\n\nProvision containers\nPush images\nCreate and import templates\n\nDevOps Administrator\nRole assigned per project. For their assigned projects DevOps administrators can perform additional actions:\n\nAdd developers and viewers and assign other DevOps administrators\nChange the project configurations, such as making the project registry public, changing deployment security settings, and enabling vulnerability scanning\n\nCloud administrator / Global Administrator for all projects\nThe default cloud administrator role is assigned to the Administrators group for vCenter Server during the installation of vSphere Integrated Containers. Through the management portal, you can revoke that role for the Administrators group, only after you assign the role to another group. Cloud administrators can also assign the role to individual users.\nThe following global permissions are unique for the cloud administrator role:\n\nAdd new cloud administrators\nCreate new projects and assign the first DevOps administrator to them\nAdd hosts and clusters as resources to a given project\nAdd and manage registries, replication endpoints, and replication rules\nAdd predefined credentials and certificates for authentication\nSet global configurations for registries handling\nView system logs\n\nExample Users\nYou can create Cloud administrator, DevOps administrator, and a Developer example users during the deployment of vSphere Integrated Containers appliance. These users create as local users for your Platform Services Controller. If you leave the default value for prefix for the users to be created, you end up with the following example users:\n\nvic-cloud-admin@local_domain\nvic-devops-admin@local_domain\nvic-developer@local_domain\n\nWhat Is vSphere Integrated Containers Registry? \nvSphere Integrated Containers Registry is an enterprise-class registry server that you can use to store and distribute container images. vSphere Integrated Containers Registry allows DevOps administrators to organize image repositories in projects, and to set up role-based access control to those projects to define which users can access which repositories. vSphere Integrated Containers Registry also provides rule-based replication of images between registries, implements Docker Content Trust, and provides detailed logging for project and user auditing.\nvSphere Integrated Containers Registry is an enterprise-class registry server that you can use to store and distribute container images. vSphere Integrated Containers Registry extends the open source Docker Distribution project by adding the features that enterprise users require, such as user management, access control, and activity auditing. You can improve image transfer efficiency by deploying vSphere Integrated Containers Registry alongside vSphere Integrated Containers Engine, so that your registry is located close to the build and run environment. \nRule Based Image Replication \nYou can set up multiple registries and replicate images between registry instances. Replicating images between registries helps with load balancing and high availability, and allows you to create multi-datacenter, hybrid, and multi-cloud setups. For information about image replication, see Replicating Images.\nDocker Content Trust \nvSphere Integrated Containers Registry provides a Docker Notary server that allows you to implement Docker Content Trust by signing and verifying the images in the registry. For information about Docker Notary, see Content trust in Docker in the Docker documentation. \nThe Notary server runs by default. For information about how container developers use Docker Content Trust with vSphere Integrated Containers Registry, see Configure the Docker Client for Use with vSphere Integrated Containers in Develop Container Applications with vSphere Integrated Containers.\nGarbage Collection \nYou can configure vSphere Integrated Containers Registry to perform garbage collection whenever you restart the registry service. If you implement garbage collection, the registry recycles the storage space that is consumed by images that you have deleted. For more information about garbage collection, see Manage Repositories. See also Garbage Collection in the Docker documentation.\nLogging \nvSphere Integrated Containers Registry keeps a log of every operation that users perform in a project. The logs are fully searchable, to assist you with activity auditing. For information about project logs, see Access Project Logs.\n"},"vic_vsphere_admin/":{"url":"vic_vsphere_admin/","title":"Install, Deploy, Maintain Infrastructure","keywords":"","body":"Install, Deploy, and Maintain the vSphere Integrated Containers Infrastructure\nInstall, Deploy, and Maintain the vSphere Integrated Containers Infrastructure provides information about how to use VMware vSphere® Integrated Containers™ as a vSphere administrator.\nProduct version: 1.2\nThis documentation applies to all 1.2.x releases.\nIntended Audience\nThis information is intended for VMware vSphere® administrators who want to install and set up vSphere Integrated Containers.

You define which networks are available to a VCH when you deploy the VCH.\nEach network that a VCH uses is a port group on either a vCenter Server instance or ESXi host. You can deploy VCHs on NSX networks.\nThis topic provides an overview of the different network types that virtual container hosts use.\n\nHigh-Level View of VCH Networking\nManagement Network\nPublic Network\nClient Network\nBridge Network\nContainer Networks\n\nHigh-Level View of VCH Networking \nThe image below shows a high-level view of the networks that a VCH uses and how they connect to your vSphere environment, to vSphere Integrated Containers Registry and Management Portal, and to the Docker environment. \n \nThe following sections describe each of the VCH network types.\nIMPORTANT: A VCH supports a maximum of 3 distinct network interfaces. The bridge network requires its own port group, at least two of the public, client, and management networks must share a network interface and therefore a port group. Container networks do not go through the VCH, so they are not subject to this limitation. This limitation will be removed in a future release.\nManagement Network \nThe network for communication between the VCH, vCenter Server, and ESXi hosts. The VCH uses this network to provide the attach function of the Docker API. \nIMPORTANT: Because the management network provides access to your vSphere environment, and because container VMs use this network to communicate with the VCH, always use a secure network for the management network. Ideally, use separate networks for the management network and the container networks.\nYou define the management network by setting the --management-network option when you run vic-machine create. For more detailed information about management networks, see the section on the --management-network option in VCH Deployment Options.\nPublic Network  \nThe network that container VMs use to connect to the internet. Ports that containers expose with docker create -p when connected to the default bridge network are made available on the public interface of the VCH endpoint VM via network address translation (NAT), so that containers can publish network services. \nYou define the public network by setting the --public-network option when you run vic-machine create. For  more detailed information about management networks, see the section on the --public-network option in VCH Deployment Options.\nClient Network \nThe network on which the VCH endpoint VM makes the Docker API available to Docker clients. The client network isolates the Docker endpoints from the public network. VCHs can access vSphere Integrated Containers Registry over the client network, but it is recommended to connect to registries either over the public network or over the management network. vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal and vSphere Integrated Containers Registry require a connection to the client network. \nYou define the Docker management endpoint network by setting the --client-network option when you run vic-machine create. For  more detailed information about Docker management endpoint networks, see the section on the --client-network option in VCH Deployment Options.\nBridge Network \nThe network or networks that container VMs use to communicate with each other. Each VCH requires a unique bridge network. The bridge network is a port group on a distributed virtual switch.\nIMPORTANT: Do not use the bridge network for any other VM workloads, or as a bridge for more than one VCH.\nYou define the bridge networks by setting the --bridge-network option when you run vic-machine create.  For  more detailed information about bridge networks, see the section on the --bridge-network option in VCH Deployment Options.\nContainer application developers can also use docker network create to create additional bridge networks. These networks are represented by the User-Created Bridge Network in the image above. Additional bridge networks are created by IP address segregation and are not new port groups. You can define a range of IP addresses that additional bridge networks can use by defining the bridge-network-range option when you run vic-machine create. For  more detailed information about  how to set bridge network ranges, see the section on the --bridge-network-range option in VCH Deployment Options. \nContainer Networks \nContainer networks allow the vSphere administrator to make vSphere networks directly available to containers. This is done during deployment of a VCH by providing a mapping of the vSphere network name to an alias that is used inside the VCH endpoint VM. The mapped networks are then listed as available by the Docker API. Running docker network ls shows these networks, and container developers can attach them to containers in the normal way by using commands such as docker run or create, with the --network=_mapped-network-name_ or docker network connect. The containers connected to container networks are connected directly to these networks, and traffic does not route though the VCH endpoint VM using NAT.\nYou can share one network alias between multiple containers. For  more detailed information about setting up container networks, see the sections on the container-network-xxx options in Virtual Container Host Deployment Options. \n"},"vic_vsphere_admin/deploy_demo_vch.html":{"url":"vic_vsphere_admin/deploy_demo_vch.html","title":"Deploy VCHs Interactively","keywords":"","body":"Deploy Virtual Container Hosts Interactively\nThe vSphere Integrated Containers appliance provides an interactive web installer from which you can deploy a basic virtual container host (VCH).

However, because the VM Network might not be present, the demo VCH requires that you create a port group for the public network. \nProcedure\n\nIn a Web browser, go to  http://vic_appliance_address, scroll down to Infrastructure Deployment Tools, click the link Go to the Demo VCH Installer Wizard, and trust the certificate. \nEnter the IP address and administrator credentials of the vCenter Server instance on which the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance is running and click Login. \nUse the drop-down menus to select the appropriate resources for each of the required resources.\n  \n\n Option\n Description\n\n\n Bridge Network\n Select an existing distributed port group for container VMs use to communicate with each other.\n\n\n Public Network\n Select a different distributed port group for container VMs use to connect to the internet.\n\n\n Image Store\n Select a datastore in which to store container images that you pull into the VCH.\n\n \n Compute Resource\n Select the host, cluster, or resource pool in which to deploy the VCH.\n\n\n(Optional) Modify the name of the VCH to create.\nLeave Thumbprint empty and click Execute. \n  The deployment of the VCH fails, but the certificate thumbprint of the target vCenter Server appears under Execution Output.\n\nCopy and paste the certificate thumbprint into Thumbprint and click Execute again.\n You can monitor the progress of the VCH deployment under Execution Output. Stay on the Installer page until the command finishes. Logs might stop streaming if you switch to other tabs or windows. \n\n\nResult\nAt the end of a successful deployment, Execution Output displays information about the new VCH.  \nWhat to Do Next\n\nConnect a Docker client to the VCH and run Docker commands against it. For information about running Docker commands against a VCH, see Verify the Deployment of a VCH.\nCopy the generated command output under Create Command and use it as a template for use with vic-machine to create production VCHs. For information about how to deploy production VCHs, see Using vic-machine to Deploy Virtual Container Hosts.\nGo to http://vic_appliance_address, click the link to Go to the vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal, enter the vCenter Server Single Sign-On credentials, and go to Home > Clusters. After creating a VCH, the web installer adds the VCH to the management portal instance that is running in the appliance. \n\n"},"vic_vsphere_admin/deploy_vch.html":{"url":"vic_vsphere_admin/deploy_vch.html","title":"Deploy VCHs with vic-machine","keywords":"","body":"\nDeploy Virtual Container Hosts with vic-machine\nAfter you deploy the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance, go to  http://vic_appliance_address in a Web browser, scroll down to Infrastructure Deployment Tools, click the link to download the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine bundle, and unpack it on your working machine.\nThe vSphere Integrated Containers Engine binaries include the vic-machine utility, that you use to deploy virtual container hosts (VCHs). \n\nContents of the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Binaries\nEnvironment Prerequisites for VCH Deployment\nOpen the Required Ports on ESXi Hosts\nDeploy a VCH to an ESXi Host with No vCenter Server\nDeploy a VCH to a Basic vCenter Server Cluster\nVerify the Deployment of a VCH\nVCH Deployment Options\nAdvanced Examples of Deploying a VCH\nDeploy a VCH for Use with vSphere Integrated Containers Registry\nUse Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation\n\n"},"vic_vsphere_admin/contents_of_vic_binaries.html":{"url":"vic_vsphere_admin/contents_of_vic_binaries.html","title":"Contents of the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Binaries","keywords":"","body":"Contents of the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Binaries\nAfter you deploy the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance, you download the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine bundle from  http://vic_appliance_address.\nWhen you unpack the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine bundle, you obtain following files:\n\n\n\nFile\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nappliance.iso\nThe Photon based boot image for the virtual container host (VCH) endpoint VM.\n\n\nbootstrap.iso\nThe Photon based boot image for the container VMs.\n\n\nui/\nA folder that contains the files and scripts for the installation of the vSphere Client plug-in.\n\n\nvic-machine-darwin\nThe OSX command line utility for the deployment and management of VCHs.\n\n\nvic-machine-linux\nThe Linux command line utility for the deployment and management of VCHs.\n\n\nvic-machine-windows.exe\nThe Windows command line utility for the deployment and management of VCHs.\n\n\nvic-ui-darwin\nThe OSX executable for the deployment of the vSphere Client plug-in.

Deploying vSphere Integrated Containers Engine to a nested ESXi host is acceptable for testing purposes only.\nIf you deploy a virtual container host (VCH) onto an ESXi host that is not managed by vCenter Server, and you then move that host into a cluster, the VCH might not function correctly.\n\nLicense Requirements \nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine requires a vSphere Enterprise Plus license.\nAll of the ESXi hosts in a cluster require an appropriate license. Deployment fails if your environment includes one or more ESXi hosts that have inadequate licenses. \nESXi Host Firewall Requirements \nTo be valid targets for VCHs and container VMs, ESXi hosts must have the following firewall configuration:\n\nAllow outbound TCP traffic to port 2377 on the endpoint VM, for use by the interactive container shell.\nAllow inbound HTTPS/TCP traffic on port 443, for uploading to and downloading from datastores.\n\nThese requirements apply to standalone ESXi hosts and to ESXi hosts in vCenter Server clusters.\nFor information about how to open ports on ESXi hosts, see Open the Required Ports on ESXi Hosts.\nESXi Host Storage Requirements for vCenter Server Clusters \nESXi hosts in vCenter Server clusters must meet the following storage requirements in order to be usable by a VCH:\n\nBe attached to the datastores that you will use for image stores and volume stores. \nHave access to shared storage to allow VCHs to use more than one host in the cluster.\n\nFor information about image stores and volumes stores, see the Datastore Options section of VCH Deployment Options.\nGeneral Network Requirements \nThe following network requirements apply to deployment of VCHs to standalone ESXi hosts and to vCenter Server:\n\nUse a trusted network for the deployment and use of vSphere Integrated Containers Engine.\nUse a trusted network for the management network.\nConnections between Docker clients and the VCH are encrypted via TLS unless you explicitly disable TLS. The client network does not need to be trusted.\nEach VCH requires an IPv4 address on each of the networks that it is connected to. The bridge network is handled internally, but other interfaces must have a static IP configured on them, or be able to acquire one via DHCP.\nEach VCH requires access to at least one network, for use as the public network. You can share this network between multiple VCHs. The public network does not need to be trusted.\nDo not share the bridge network interface with with any other network, unless you ensure that the bridge IP ranges do not conflict with other VCHs or VMs on that network. It is highly recommended that a bridge network be solely for use by only one VCH.\n\nvCenter Server Network Requirements \nThe following network requirements apply to the deployment of VCHs to vCenter Server: \n\nCreate a distributed virtual switch with a port group for each VCH, for use as the bridge network. You can create multiple port groups on the same distributed virtual switch, but each VCH requires its own port group for the bridge network.\nOptionally create port groups for use as mapped container networks, or for the public, management, and client networks.\nAll hosts in a cluster must be attached to the port groups that you will use for the VCH bridge network and for any mapped container networks.\nIsolate the bridge network and any mapped container networks. You can isolate networks by using a separate VLAN for each network. \n\nFor information about bridge networks and container networks, see the --bridge-network and --container-network options in VCH Deployment Options. \nFor information about how to create a distributed virtual switch and a port group, see Create a vSphere Distributed Switch in the vSphere  documentation. \nFor information about how to add hosts to a distributed virtual switch, see Add Hosts to a vSphere Distributed Switch in the vSphere  documentation.\nFor information about how to assign a VLAN ID to a port group, see VMware KB 1003825.

However, running vic-machine create with the --force option rather than providing the certificate thumbprint is not recommended, because it permits man-in-the-middle attacks to go undetected.\nTo obtain the thumbprint of the vCenter Server or ESXi host certificate, run vic-machine create without the specifying the --thumbprint or --force options. The deployment of the VCH fails, but the resulting error message includes the required certificate thumbprint.

The generated certificates are functional, but they do not allow for fine control over aspects such as expiration, intermediate certificate authorities, and so on.\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine authenticates Docker API clients by using client certificates. This configuration is commonly referred to as tlsverify in documentation about containers and Docker. A client certificate is accepted if it is signed by a CA that you provide by specifying one or more instances of the --tls-ca option. In the case of the certificates that vic-machine create generates, vic-machine create creates a CA and uses it to create and sign a single client certificate.\nWhen using the Docker client, the client validates the server either by using CAs that are present in the root certificate bundle of the client system, or that are provided explicitly by using the --tlscacert option when running Docker commands. As a part of this validation, the server certificate must explicitly state at least one of the following, and must match the name or address that the client uses to access the server:\n\nThe FQDN used to communicate with the server\nThe IP address used to communicate with the server\nA wildcard domain that matches all of the FQDNs in a specific subdomain. For an example of a domain wildcard, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_certificate#Example.\n\n--tls-cname \nShort name: None\nThe FQDN or IP address to embed in an auto-generated server certificate. Specify an FQDN, IP address, or a domain wildcard. If you provide a custom server certificate by using the --tls-server-cert option, you can use --tls-cname as a sanity check to ensure that the certificate is valid for the deployment.\nIf you do not specify --tls-cname but you do set a static address for the VCH on the client network interface, vic-machine create uses that  address for the Common Name, with the same results as if you had specified --tls-cname=x.x.x.x. For information about setting a static IP address on the client network, see Specify a Static IP Address for the VCH Endpoint VM.\nWhen you specify the --tls-cname option, vic-machine create performs the following actions during the deployment of the VCH:\n\nChecks for an existing certificate in either a folder that has the same name as the VCH that you are deploying, or in a location that you specify in the --tls-cert-path option. If a valid certificate exists that includes the same Common Name attribute as the one that you specify in --tls-cname, vic-machine create reuses it. Reusing certificates allows you to delete and recreate VCHs for which you have already distributed the certificates to container developers.\nIf certificates are present in the certificate folder that include a different Common Name attribute to the one that you specify in --tls-cname, vic-machine create fails.  \nIf a certificate folder does not exist, vic-machine create creates a folder with the same name as the VCH, or creates a folder in the location that you specify in the --tls-cert-path option. \nIf valid certificates do not already exist, vic-machine create creates the following trusted CA, server, and client certificate/key pairs in the certificate folder:\nca.pem\nca-key.pem\ncert.pem\nkey.pem\nserver-cert.pem\nserver-key.pem\n\n\nCreates a browser-friendly PFX client certificate, cert.pfx, to use to authenticate connections to the VCH Admin portal for the VCH.\n\nNOTE: The folder and file permissions for the generated certificate and key are readable only by the user who created them.\nRunning vic-machine create with the --tls-cname option also creates an environment file named vch_name.env, that contains Docker environment variables that container developers can use to configure their Docker client environment:\n\nActivates TLS client verification.DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1\nThe path to the client certificates.DOCKER_CERT_PATH=path_to_certs\nThe address of the VCH.DOCKER_HOST=vch_address:2376\n\nYou must provide copies of the cert.pem and key.pem client certificate files and the environment file to container developers so that they can connect Docker clients to the VCH. If you deploy the VCH with the --tls-cname option, container developers must configure the client appropriately with one of the following options:\n\nBy using the following tlsverify, tlscert, and tlskey Docker options, adding tlscacert if a custom CA was used to sign the server certificate.\nBy setting DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/path/to/client/cert.pem and DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1.\n\n--tls-cname vch-name.example.org\n--tls-cname *.example.org\n\n--tls-cert-path \nShort name: none\nBy default --tls-cert-path is a folder in the current directory, that takes its name from the VCH name that you specify in the --name option. vic-machine create checks in --tls-cert-path for existing certificates with the standard names and uses those certificates if they are present:\n\nserver-cert.pem \nserver-key.pem\nca.pem\n\nIf vic-machine create does not find existing certificates with the standard names in --tls-cert-path, or if you do not specify certificates directly by using the --tls-server-cert, --tls-server-key, and --tls-ca options, vic-machine create generates certificates. Generated certificates are saved in the --tls-cert-path folder with the standard names listed. vic-machine create additionally generates other certificates:\n\ncert.pem and key.pem for client certificates, if required.\nca-key.pem, the private key for the certificate authority. \n\n--tls-cert-path 'path_to_certificate_folder'\n\n\n--certificate-key-size\nShort name: --ksz\nThe size of the key for vic-machine create to use when it creates auto-generated trusted certificates. You can optionally use --certificate-key-size if you specify --tls-cname. If not specified, vic-machine create creates keys with default size of 2048 bits. It is not recommended to use key sizes of less than 2048 bits. \n--certificate-key-size 3072\n\n--organization\nShort name: None\nA list of identifiers to record in certificates generated by vic-machine. You can optionally use --organization if you specify --tls-cname. If not specified,vic-machine create uses the name of the VCH as the organization value.\nNOTE: The client-ip-address is used for CommonName but not  for  Organisation.\n--organization organization_name\n\nRestrict Access to the Docker API with Custom Certificates \nTo exercise fine control over the certificates that VCHs use, obtain or generate custom certificates yourself before you deploy a VCH. Use the --tls-server-key, --tls-server-cert, and --tls-ca options to pass the custom certificates to vic-machine create.\n--tls-server-cert \nShort name: none\nThe path to a custom X.509 server certificate. This certificate identifies the VCH endpoint VM both to Docker clients and to browsers that connect to the VCH Admin portal.\n\nThis certificate should have the following certificate usages:\nKeyEncipherment\nDigitalSignature\nKeyAgreement\nServerAuth\n\n\nThis option is mandatory if you use custom TLS certificates, rather than auto-generated certificates.\nUse this option in combination with the --tls-server-key option, that provides the path to the private key file for the custom certificate.\nInclude the names of the certificate and key files in the paths.\nIf you use trusted custom certificates, container developers run Docker commands with the --tlsverify, --tlscacert, --tlscert, and --tlskey options.\n\n--tls-server-cert path_to_certificate_file/certificate_file_name.pem \n--tls-server-key path_to_key_file/key_file_name.pem\n \n\n--tls-server-key \nShort name: none\nThe path to the private key file to use with a custom server certificate. This option is mandatory if you specify the --tls-server-cert option, that provides the path to a custom X.509 certificate file. Include the names of the certificate and key files in the paths. \nIMPORTANT: The key must not be encrypted.\n--tls-server-cert path_to_certificate_file/certificate_file_name.pem \n--tls-server-key path_to_key_file/key_file_name.pem\n \n\n--tls-ca \nShort name: --ca\nYou can specify --tls-ca multiple times, to point vic-machine create to a file that contains the public portion of a CA. vic-machine create uses these CAs to validate client certificates that are offered as credentials for Docker API access. This does not need to be the same CA that you use to sign the server certificate.\n--tls-ca path_to_ca_file\n\nNOTE: The --tls-ca option appears in the extended help that you see by running vic-machine-os create --extended-help or vic-machine-os create -x.\nDo Not Restrict Access to the Docker API \nTo deploy a VCH that does not restrict access to the Docker API, use the --no-tlsverify option. To completely disable TLS authentication, use the --no-tls option.\n--no-tlsverify \nShort name: --kv\nThe --no-tlsverify option prevents the use of CAs for client authentication. You still require a server certificate if you use --no-tlsverify. You can still supply a custom server certificate by using the  --tls-server-cert and --tls-server-key  options. If you do not use --tls-server-cert and --tls-server-key to supply a custom server certificate, vic-machine create generates a self-signed server certificate. If you specify --no-tlsverify there is no access control, however connections remain encrypted.\nWhen you specify the --no-tlsverify option, vic-machine create performs the following actions during the deployment of the VCH.\n\nGenerates a self-signed server certificate if you do not specify --tls-server-cert and --tls-server-key.\nCreates a folder with the same name as the VCH in the location in which you run vic-machine create.\nCreates an environment file named vch_name.env in that folder, that contains the DOCKER_HOST=vch_address environment variable, that you can provide to container developers to use to set up their Docker client environment.\n\nIf you deploy a VCH with the --no-tlsverify option, container developers run Docker commands with the --tls option, and the DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY environment variable must not be set. Note that setting DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY to 0 or false has no effect. \nThe --no-tlsverify option takes no arguments. \n--no-tlsverify\n\n--no-tls \nShort name: -k\nDisables TLS authentication of connections between the Docker client and the VCH. VCHs use neither client nor server certificates.\nSet the no-tls option if you do not require TLS authentication between the VCH and the Docker client. Any Docker client can connect to the VCH if you disable TLS authentication and connections are not encrypted. \nIf you use the no-tls option, container developers connect Docker clients to the VCH via port 2375, instead of via port 2376.\n--no-tls\n\nSpecify Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation \nBecause deploying a VCH requires greater levels of permissions than running a VCH, you can configure a VCH so that it uses different user accounts for deployment and for operation. In this way, you can limit the day-to-day operation of a VCH to an account that does not have full administrator permissions on the target vCenter Server.\n--ops-user \nShort name: None\nA vSphere user account with which the VCH runs after deployment. If not specified, the VCH runs with the vSphere Administrator credentials with which you deploy the VCH, that you specify in either --target or --user.\n--ops-user user_name\n\nThe user account that you specify in --ops-user must exist before you deploy the VCH. For information about the permissions that the --ops-user account requires, see Use Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation.\n--ops-password\nShort name: None\nThe password or token for the operations user that you specify in --ops-user. If not specified, vic-machine create prompts you to enter the password for the --ops-user account.\n--ops-password password\n\nPrivate Registry Options \nIf you use vSphere Integrated Containers Registry, or if container developers need to access Docker images that are stored in other private registry servers, you must configure VCHs to allow them to connect to these private registry servers when you deploy the VCHs. VCHs can connect to both secure and insecure private registry servers.\n--registry-ca \nShort name: --rc\nThe path to a CA certificate that can validate the server certificate of a private registry. You can specify --registry-ca multiple times to specify multiple CA certificates for different registries. This allows a VCH to connect to multiple registries. \nThe use of registry certificates is independent of the Docker client security options that you specify. For example, it is possible to use the --no-tls option to disable TLS authentication between Docker clients and the VCH, and to use the --registry-ca option to enable TLS authentication  between the VCH and a private registry. \nYou must use this option to allow a VCH to connect to vSphere Integrated Containers Registry. For information about how to obtain the CA certificate from vSphere Integrated Containers Registry, see Deploy a VCH for Use with vSphere Integrated Containers Registry.\n--registry-ca path_to_ca_cert_1\n--registry-ca path_to_ca_cert_2\n\n\nNOTE: The --registry-ca option appears in the extended help that you see by running vic-machine-os create --extended-help or vic-machine-os create -x.\n--insecure-registry \nShort name: --dir\nIf you set the --insecure-registry option, the VCH does not verify the certificate of that registry when it pulls images. Insecure private registries are not recommended in production environments.\nIf you authorize a VCH to connect to an insecure private registry server, the VCH attempts to access the registry server via HTTP if access via HTTPS fails. VCHs always use HTTPS when connecting to registry servers for which you have not authorized insecure access.\nNOTE: You cannot configure VCHs to connect to vSphere Integrated Containers Registry instances as insecure registries. Connections to vSphere Integrated Containers Registry always require HTTPS and a certificate.\nYou can specify --insecure-registry multiple times if multiple insecure registries are permitted. If the registry server listens on a specific port, add the port number to the URL\n--insecure-registry registry_URL_1\n--insecure-registry registry_URL_2:port_number\n\n\n\nDatastore Options \nThe vic-machine utility allows you to specify the datastore in which to store container image files, container VM files, and the files for the VCH. You can also specify datastores in which to create container volumes. \n\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine fully supports VMware vSAN datastores. \nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine supports all alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores in datastore paths and datastore names, but no other special characters.\nIf you specify different datastores in the different datastore options, and if no single host in a cluster can access all of those datastores, vic-machine create fails with an error.  No single host can access all of the requested datastores. \nInstallation cannot continue.\nIf you specify different datastores in the different datastore options, and if only one host in a cluster can access all of them, vic-machine create succeeds with a warning.  Only one host can access all of the image/container/volume datastores. \nThis may be a point of contention/performance degradation and HA/DRS \nmay not work as intended. \nVCHs do not support datastore name changes. If a datastore changes name after you have deployed a VCH that uses that datastore, that VCH will no longer function.\n\n--image-store \nShort name: -i\nThe datastore in which to store container image files, container VM files, and the files for the VCH. The --image-store option is mandatory if there is more than one datastore in your vSphere environment. If there is only one datastore in your vSphere environment, the --image-store option is not required. \nIf you do not specify the --image-store option and multiple possible datastores exist, or if you specify an invalid datastore name, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid datastores in the failure message. \nIf you are deploying the VCH to a vCenter Server cluster, the datastore that you designate in the image-store option must be shared by at least two ESXi hosts in the cluster. Using non-shared datastores is possible, but limits the use of vSphere features such as vSphere vMotion® and VMware vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler™ (DRS).\nTo specify a whole datastore as the image store, specify the datastore name in the --image-store option:\n--image-store datastore_name\n\nIf you designate a whole datastore as the image store, vic-machine creates the following set of folders in the target datastore: \n\ndatastore_name/VIC/vch_uuid/images, in which to store all of the container images that you pull into the VCH.\ndatastore_name/vch_name, that contains the VM files for the VCH.\ndatastore_name/vch_name/kvstores, a key-value store folder for the VCH.\n\nYou can specify a datastore folder to use as the image store by specifying a path in the --image-store option: \n--image-store datastore_name/path \n\nIf the folder that you specify in /path does not already exist, vic-machine create creates it.\nIf you designate a datastore folder as the image store, vic-machine creates the following set of folders in the target datastore:\n\ndatastore_name/path/VIC/vcu_uuid/images, in which to store all of the container images that you pull into the VCH. \ndatastore_name/vch_name, that contains the VM files for the VCH. This is the same as if you specified a datastore as the image store.\ndatastore_name/vch_name/kvstores, a key-value store folder for the VCH. This is the same as if you specified a datastore as the image store.\n\nBy specifying the path to a datastore folder in the --image-store option, you can designate the same datastore folder as the image store for multiple VCHs. In this way, vic-machine create creates only one VIC folder in the datastore, at the path that you specify. The VIC folder contains one vch_uuid/images folder for each VCH that you deploy. By creating one vch_uuid/images folder for each VCH, vSphere Integrated Containers Engine limits the potential for conflicts of image use between VCHs, even if you share the same image store folder between multiple hosts.\nWhen container developers create containers, vSphere Integrated Containers Engine stores the files for container VMs at the top level of the image store, in folders that have the same name as the containers.\n--volume-store \nShort name: --vs\nThe datastore in which to create volumes when container developers use the docker volume create command. You can specify either a datastore that is backed by vSphere or an NFS share point as the volume store.\nIf you are deploying the VCH to a vCenter Server cluster, vSphere datastores that you designate in the volume-store option should be shared by at least two ESXi hosts in the cluster. Using non-shared datastores is possible and vic-machine create succeeds, but it issues a warning that this configuration limits the use of vSphere features such as vSphere vMotion and DRS.\nIf you use NFS volume stores, container developers can share the data in those volumes between containers by attaching the same volume to multiple containers. For example, you can use shared NFS volume stores to share configuration information between containers, or  to allow containers to access the data of another container. To use shared NFS volume stores, it is recommended that the NFS share points that you designate as the volume stores be directly accessible by the network that you use as the container network. For information about container networks, see the description of the --container-network option.\nThe label that you specify is the volume store name that Docker uses. For example, the volume store label appears in the information for a VCH when container developers run docker info. Container developers specify the volume store label in the docker volume create --opt VolumeStore=volume_store_label option when they create a volume.\nIMPORTANT: The volume store label must be unique.\nIf you specify an invalid vSphere datastore name or an invalid NFS share point URL, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid datastores. \nIMPORTANT If you do not specify the volume-store option, no  volume store is created and container developers cannot create containers with volumes. You can add volume stores to a VCH after deployment by running vic-machine configure --volume-store. For information about adding volume stores after deployment, see Add Volume Stores in Configure Virtual Container Hosts.\n\nTo specify a vSphere datastore, provide the datastore name and the volume store label. \n  --volume-store datastore_name:volume_store_label\n\n  You can optionally use the ds:// prefix to specify a datastore that is backed by vSphere.\n  --volume-store ds://datastore_name:volume_store_label\n\n  If you specify a vSphere datastore without specifying a path to a specific datastore folder, vic-machine create creates a folder named VIC/volumes at the top level of the target datastore. Any volumes that container developers create will appear in the VIC/volumes folder. \n\nIf you specify a vSphere datastore and a datastore path, vic-machine create creates a folder named volumes in the location that you specify in the datastore path. If the folders that you specify in the path do not already exist on the datastore, vic-machine create creates the appropriate folder structure.  Any volumes that container developers create will appear in the path/volumes folder. \n  --volume-store datastore_name/datastore_path:volume_store_label    \n\n  The vic-machine create command creates the volumes folder independently from the folders for VCH files so that you can share volume stores between VCHs. If you delete a VCH, any volumes that the VCH managed will remain available in the volume store unless you specify the --force option when you delete the VCH. You can then assign an existing volume store that already contains data to a newly created VCH. \n   IMPORTANT: If multiple VCHs will use the same datastore for their volume stores, specify a different datastore folder for each VCH. Do not designate the same datastore folder as the volume store for multiple VCHs.\n\nTo specify an NFS share point as a volume store, use the nfs:// prefix and the path to a shared mount point.\n  IMPORTANT: When container developers run docker info or docker volume ls against a VCH, there is currently no indication whether a volume store is backed by vSphere or by an NFS share point. Consequently, you should include an indication that a volume store is an NFS share point in the volume store label. \n  nfs://datastore_name/path_to_share_point:nfs_volume_store_label\nYou can specify the volume-store option multiple times, to create multiple volume stores for the VCH.\n\nYou can also specify the URL, UID, GID, and access protocol of a shared NFS mount point when you specify an NFS share point.\n--volume-store nfs://datastore_address/path_to_share_point?uid=1234&gid=5678&proto=tcp:nfs_volume_store_label\n\nIf you do not specify a UID and GID, vSphere Integrated Containers Engine uses te `anon` UID and GID when creating and interacting with the volume store. The `anon` UID and GID is 1000.    \n\nYou cannot specify the root folder of an NFS server as a volume store. \n\nIf you only require one volume store, set the volume store label to default. If you set the volume store label to default, container developers do not need to specify the --opt VolumeStore=volume_store_label option when they run docker volume create. \n  NOTE: If container developers intend to use docker create -v to create containers that are attached to anonymous or named volumes, you must create a volume store with a label of default.\n  --volume-store datastore_name:default\n  --volume-store nfs://datastore_name/path_to_share_point:default\n\nYou can specify the volume-store option multiple times, to create multiple volume stores for the VCH. You can add a mixture of vSphere datastores and NFS share points to a VCH.\n  --volume-store datastore_name/path:volume_store_label_1\n--volume-store datastore_name/path:volume_store_label_2\n--volume-store nfs://datastore_name/path_to_share_point:nfs_volume_store_label\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworking Options \nThe vic-machine create utility allows you to specify different networks for the different types of traffic between containers, the VCH, the external internet, and your vSphere environment. For information about the different networks that VCHs use, see Virtual Container Host Networking.\nIMPORTANT: A VCH supports a maximum of 3 distinct network interfaces. Because the bridge network requires its own port group, at least two of the public, client, and management networks must share a network interface and therefore a port group. Container networks do not go through the VCH, so they are not subject to this limitation. This limitation will be removed in a future release.\nBy default, vic-machine create obtains IP addresses for VCH endpoint VMs by using DHCP. For information about how to specify a static IP address for the VCH endpoint VM on the client, public, and management networks, see Specify a Static IP Address for the VCH Endpoint VM in Advanced Options.\nIf your network access is controlled by a proxy server, see Configure VCHs to Use Proxy Servers in Advanced Options. \nWhen you specify different network interfaces for the different types of traffic, vic-machine create checks that the firewalls on the ESXi hosts allow connections to port 2377 from those networks. If access to port 2377 on one or more ESXi hosts is subject to IP address restrictions, and if those restrictions block access to the network interfaces that you specify, vic-machine create fails with a firewall configuration error:\nFirewall configuration incorrect due to allowed IP restrictions on hosts: \n\"/ha-datacenter/host/localhost.localdomain/localhost.localdomain\" \nFirewall must permit dst 2377/tcp outbound to the VCH management interface\n\n\nFor information about how to open port 2377, see Open the Required Ports on ESXi Hosts.\n--bridge-network \nShort name: -b\nA port group that container VMs use to communicate with each other. \nThe bridge-network option is mandatory if you are deploying a VCH to vCenter Server.\nIn a vCenter Server environment, before you run vic-machine create, you must create a distributed virtual switch and a port group. You must add the target ESXi host or hosts to the distributed virtual switch, and assign a VLAN ID to the port group, to ensure that the bridge network is isolated. For information about how to create a distributed virtual switch and port group, see the section on vCenter Server Network Requirements in Environment Prerequisites for VCH Deployment.\nYou pass the name of the port group to the bridge-network option. Each VCH requires its own port group. \nIMPORTANT \n\nDo not assign the same bridge-network port group to multiple VCHs. Sharing a port group between VCHs might result in multiple container VMs being assigned the same IP address. \nDo not use the bridge-network port group as the target for any of the other vic-machine create networking options.\n\nIf you specify an invalid port group name, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid port groups.\nThe bridge-network option is optional when you are deploying a VCH to an ESXi host with no vCenter Server. In this case, if you do not specify bridge-network, vic-machine creates a  virtual switch and a port group that each have the same name as the VCH. You can optionally specify this option to assign an existing port group for use as the bridge network for container VMs. You can also optionally specify this option to create a new virtual switch and port group that have a different name to the VCH.\n--bridge-network port_group_name\n\nIf you intend to use the --ops-user option to use different user accounts for deployment and operation of the VCH, you must place the bridge network port group in a network folder that has the Read-Only role with propagation enabled. For more information about the requirements when using --ops-user, see Use Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation. \nFor information about how to specify a range of IP addresses for additional bridge networks, see bridge-network-range in Advanced Networking Options.\n--client-network \nShort name: --cln\nA port group on which the VCH will make the Docker API available to Docker clients. Docker clients use this network to issue Docker API requests to the VCH.\nIf not specified, the VCH uses the public network for client traffic. If you specify an invalid port group name, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid port groups.\n--client-network port_group_name\n\n--public-network \nShort name: --pn\nA port group for containers to use to connect to the Internet. VCHs use the public network to pull container images, for example from https://hub.docker.com/. Containers that use use port mapping expose network services on the public interface. \nNOTE: vSphere Integrated Containers Engine adds a new capability to Docker that allows you to directly map containers to a network by using the --container-network option. This is the recommended way to deploy container services.\nIf not specified, containers use the VM Network for public network traffic. If you specify an invalid port group name, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid port groups.\n--public-network port_group\n\n--management-network \nShort name: --mn\nA port group that the VCH uses to communicate with vCenter Server and ESXi hosts. Container VMs use this network to communicate with the VCH. \nIMPORTANT: Because the management network provides access to your vSphere environment, and because container VMs use this network to communicate with the VCH, always use a secure network for the management network.\nWhen you create a VCH, vic-machine create checks that the firewall on ESXi hosts allows connections to port 2377 from the management network of the VCH. If access to port 2377 on ESXi hosts is subject to IP address restrictions, and if those restrictions block access to the management network interface, vic-machine create fails with a firewall configuration error:\nFirewall configuration incorrect due to allowed IP restrictions on hosts: \n\"/ha-datacenter/host/localhost.localdomain/localhost.localdomain\" \nFirewall must permit dst 2377/tcp outbound to the VCH management interface\n\n\nFor information about how to open port 2377, see Open the Required Ports on ESXi Hosts.\nNOTE: If the management network uses DHCP, vic-machine checks the firewall status of the management network before the VCH receives an IP address. It is therefore not possible to fully assess whether the firewall permits the IP address of the VCH. In this case, vic-machine create issues a warning. \nUnable to fully verify firewall configuration due to DHCP use on management network \nVCH management interface IP assigned by DHCP must be permitted by allowed IP settings \nFirewall allowed IP configuration may prevent required connection on hosts: \n\"/ha-datacenter/host/localhost.localdomain/localhost.localdomain\" \nFirewall must permit dst 2377/tcp outbound to the VCH management interface\n\n\nIf not specified, the VCH uses the public network for management traffic. If you specify an invalid port group name, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid port groups.\n--management-network port_group_name\n\n\n--container-network \nShort name: --cn\nA port group for container VMs to use for external communication when container developers  run docker run or docker create with the --net option. \nYou can optionally specify one or more container networks. Container networks allow containers to directly attach to a network without having to route through the VCH via network address translation (NAT). Container networks that you add by using the --container-network option appear when you run the docker network ls command. These networks are available for use by containers. Containers that use these networks are directly attached to the container network, and do not go through the VCH or share the public IP of the VCH. \nIf you use shared NFS share points as volumes stores, it is recommended to make the NFS target accessible by the container network. If you use NFS volume stores and you do not specify a container network, containers use NAT to route traffic to the NFS target through the VCH endpoint VM. This can create potential bottlenecks and a single point of failure. \nIMPORTANT: For security reasons, whenever possible, use separate port groups for the container network and the management network.\nTo specify a container network, you provide the name of a port group for the container VMs to use, and an optional descriptive name for the container network for use by Docker.  If you do not specify a descriptive name, Docker uses the vSphere network name. \nIMPORTANT:  The descriptive name is optional unless the port group name contains spaces. If the port group name contains spaces, you must specify a descriptive name.  The descriptive name cannot contain spaces.\nIf you specify an invalid port group name, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid port groups.\n\nYou can specify a vSphere network as the container network.\nThe port group must exist before you run vic-machine create. \nYou cannot use the same port group as you use for the bridge network. \nYou can create the port group on the same distributed virtual switch as the port group that you use for the bridge network.\nIf the port group that you specify in the container-network option does not support DHCP, see Configure Container Networks in Advanced Options. \nThe descriptive name appears under Networks when you run docker info or docker network ls on the deployed VCH. The descriptive name cannot include spaces.\nContainer developers use the descriptive name in the --net option when they run docker run or docker create.\n\nYou can specify --container-network multiple times to add multiple vSphere networks to Docker.\nIf you do not specify --container-network, or if you deploy containers that do not use a container network, the containers' network services are still be available via port mapping through the VCH, by using NAT through the public interface of the VCH.\n--container-network port_group_name:container_port _group_name\n\nIf you intend to use the --ops-user option to use different user accounts for deployment and operation of the VCH, you must place any container network port groups in a network folder that has the Read-Only role with propagation enabled. For more information about the requirements when using --ops-user, see Use Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation.\nGeneral Deployment Options \nThe vic-machine utility provides options to customize the VCH.\n--name\nShort name: -n\nA name for the VCH. If not specified, vic-machine sets the name of the VCH to virtual-container-host. If a VCH of the same name exists on the ESXi host or in the vCenter Server inventory, or if a folder of the same name exists in the target datastore, vic-machine create creates a folder named vch_name_1. If the name that you provide contains unsupported characters, vic-machine create fails with an error.\n--name vch_name\n\n--memory\nShort name: --mem\nLimit the amount of memory that is available for use by the VCH vApp in vCenter Server, or for the VCH resource pool on an ESXi host. This limit also applies to the container VMs that run in the VCH vApp or resource pool. Specify the memory limit value in MB. If not specified, vic-machine create sets the limit to 0 (unlimited).\n--memory 1024\n\n--cpu\nShort name: None\nLimit the amount of CPU capacity that is available for use by the VCH vApp in vCenter Server, or for the VCH resource pool on an ESXi host. This limit also applies to the container VMs that run in the VCH vApp or resource pool. Specify the CPU limit value in MHz. If not specified, vic-machine create sets the limit to 0 (unlimited).\n--cpu 1024\n\n--force\nShort name: -f\nForces vic-machine create to ignore warnings and non-fatal errors and continue with the deployment of a VCH. Errors such as an incorrect compute resource still cause the deployment to fail.\nIf your vSphere environment uses untrusted, self-signed certificates, you can use the --force option to deploy a VCH without providing the thumbprint of the vCenter Server or ESXi host in the thumbprint option. \nIMPORTANT Running vic-machine create with the --force option rather than providing the certificate thumbprint is not recommended, because it permits man-in-the-middle attacks to go undetected.\n--force\n\n--timeout\nShort name: none\nThe timeout period for uploading the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine files and ISOs to the ESXi host, and for powering on the VCH. Specify a value in the format XmYs if the default timeout of 3m0s is insufficient.\n--timeout 5m0s \n\n\nAdvanced Options \nThe options in this section are exposed in the vic-machine create help if you run vic-machine create --extended-help, or vic-machine create -x. \nSpecify a Static IP Address for the VCH Endpoint VM \nYou can specify a static IP address for the VCH endpoint VM on each of the client, public, and management networks. DHCP is used for the endpoint VM for any network on which you do not specify a static IP address.\nTo specify a static IP address for the endpoint VM on the client, public, or management network, you provide an IP address in the client/public/management-network-ip option. If you set a static IP address, you can optionally provide gateway addresses and specify one or more DNS server addresses.\n--dns-server \nShort name: None\nA DNS server for the VCH endpoint VM to use on the client, public, or management networks. You can specify dns-server multiple times, to configure multiple DNS servers.  \n\nIf you specify dns-server, vic-machine create always uses the --dns-server setting for all three of the client, public, and management networks.\nIf you do not specify dns-server and you specify a static IP address for the endpoint VM on all three of the client, public, and management networks, vic-machine create uses the Google public DNS service. \nIf you do not specify dns-server and you use a mixture of static IP addresses and DHCP for the client, public, and management networks, vic-machine create uses the DNS servers that DHCP provides.\nIf you do not specify dns-server and you use DHCP for all of the client, public, and management networks, vic-machine create uses the DNS servers that DHCP provides.\n\n--dns-server=172.16.10.10\n--dns-server=172.16.10.11\n\n\n--client-network-ip, --public-network-ip, --management-network-ip\nShort name: None\nA static IP address for the VCH endpoint VM on the public, client, or management network. \nYou specify a static IP address for the endpoint VM on the public, client, or management networks by using the --public/client/management-network-ip options. If you set a static IP address for the endpoint VM on the public network, you must specify a corresponding gateway address by using the --public-network-gateway option. If the management and client networks are L2 adjacent to their gateways, you do not need to specify the gateway for those networks.\n\nYou can only specify one static IP address on a given port group. If more than one of the client, public, or management networks share a port group, you can only specify a static IP address on one of those networks. All of the networks that share that port group use the IP address that you specify. \nIf either of the client or management networks shares a port group with the public network, you can only specify a static IP address on the public network.\nIf either or both of the client or management networks do not use the same port group as the public network, you can specify a static IP address for the endpoint VM on those networks by using --client-network-ip or --management-network-ip, or both. In this case, you must specify a corresponding gateway address by using client/management-network-gateway. \nIf the client and management networks both use the same port group, and the public network does not use that port group, you can set a static IP address for the endpoint VM on either or both of the client and management networks.\nIf you assign a static IP address to the VCH endpoint VM on the client network by setting the --client-network-ip option, and you do not specify one of the TLS options, vic-machine create uses this address as the Common Name with which to auto-generate trusted CA certificates. If you do not specify --tls-cname, --no-tls or --no-tlsverify, two-way TLS authentication with trusted certificates is implemented by default when you deploy the VCH with a static IP address on the client network. If you assign a static IP address to the endpoint VM on the client network, vic-machine create creates the same certificate and environment variable files as described in the --tls-cname option.\nIMPORTANT: If the client network shares a port group with the public network you cannot set a static IP address for the endpoint VM on the client network. To assign a static IP address to the endpoint VM you must set a static IP address on the public network by using the --public-network-ip option. In this case, vic-machine create uses the public network IP address as the Common Name with which to auto-generate trusted CA certificates, in the same way as it would for the client network.\n\nIf you do not specify an IP address for the endpoint VM on a given network, vic-machine create uses DHCP to obtain an IP address for the endpoint VM on that network.\n\n\nYou specify addresses as IPv4 addresses with a network mask.\n--public-network-ip 192.168.X.N/24\n--management-network-ip 192.168.Y.N/24\n--client-network-ip 192.168.Z.N/24\n\n\nYou can also specify addresses as resolvable FQDNs.\n--public-network-ip=vch27-team-a.internal.domain.com\n--management-network-ip=vch27-team-b.internal.domain.com\n--client-network-ip=vch27-team-c.internal.domain.com\n\n\n--client-network-gateway, --public-network-gateway, --management-network-gateway\nShort name: None\nThe gateway to use if you use --public/client/management-network-ip to specify a static IP address for the VCH endpoint VM on the public, client, or management networks. If you specify a static IP address on the public network, you must specify a gateway by using the --public-network-gateway option. If the management and client networks are L2 adjacent to their gateways, you do not need to specify the gateway for those networks.\nYou specify gateway addresses as IP addresses without a network mask.\n--public-network-gateway 192.168.X.1\n\nThe default route for the VCH endpoint VM is always on the public network. As a consequence, if you specify a static IP address on either of the management or client networks and those networks are not L2 adjacent to their gateways, you must specify the routing destination for those networks in the --management-network-gateway and --client-network-gateway options. You specify the routing destination or destinations in a comma-separated list, with the address of the gateway separated from the routing destinations by a colon (:).\n--management-network-gateway routing_destination_1,\nrouting_destination_2:gateway_address\n--client-network-gateway routing_destination_1,\nrouting_destination_2:gateway_address\n\nIn the following example, --management-network-gateway informs the VCH that it can reach all of the vSphere management endoints that are in the ranges 192.168.3.0-255 and 192.168.128.0-192.168.131.255 by sending packets to the gateway at 192.168.2.1. Ensure that the address ranges that you specify include all of the systems that will connect to this VCH instance. \n--management-network-gateway 192.168.3.0,192.168.128.0:192.168.2.1\n\nConfigure Container Networks \nIf the network that you specify in the container-network option does not support DHCP, you must specify the container-network-gateway option. You can optionally specify one or more DNS servers and a range of IP addresses for container VMs on the container network. \nFor information about the container network, see the section on the container-network option.\n--container-network-gateway\nShort name: --cng\nThe gateway for the subnet of the container network. This option is required if the network that you specify in the --container-network option does not support DHCP. Specify the gateway in the format container_network:subnet. If you specify this option, it is recommended that you also specify the  --container-network-dns option.\nWhen you specify the container network gateway, you must use the port group that you specify in the --container-network option. If you specify --container-network-gateway but you do not specify --container-network, or if you specify a different port group to the one that you specify in --container-network, vic-machine create fails with an error.\n--container-network-gateway port_group_name:gateway_ip_address/subnet_mask\n\n--container-network-dns\nShort name: --cnd\nThe address of the DNS server for the container network. This option is recommended if the network that you specify in the --container-network option does not support DHCP. \nWhen you specify the container network DNS server, you must use the  port group that you specify in the --container-network option. You can specify --container-network-dns multiple times, to configure multiple DNS servers. If you specify --container-network-dns but you do not specify --container-network, or if you specify a different port group to the one that you specify in --container-network, vic-machine create fails with an error.\n--container-network-dns port_group_name:8.8.8.8\n\n--container-network-ip-range \nShort name: --cnr\nThe range of IP addresses that container VMs can use if the network that you specify in the container-network option does not support DHCP. If you specify --container-network-ip-range, VCHs manage the addresses for containers within that range. The range that you specify must not be used by other computers or VMs on the network.  You must also specify --container-network-ip-range if container developers need to deploy containers with static IP addresses. If you specify container-network-gateway but do not specify --container-network-ip-range, the IP range for container VMs is the entire subnet that you specify in --container-network-gateway. \nWhen you specify the container network IP range, you must use the port group that you specify in the --container-networkoption. If you specify --container-network-ip-range but you do not specify --container-network, or if you specify a different port group to the one that you specify in --container-network, vic-machine create fails with an error.\n--container-network-ip-range port_group_name:192.168.100.2-192.168.100.254\n\nYou can also specify the IP range as a CIDR.\n--container-network-ip-range port_group_name:192.168.100.0/24\n\n--container-network-firewall  \nShort name: --cnf\nYou can configure the trust level of container networks by setting the \n--container-network-firewall option. \nThe --container-network-firewall option allows you to set the following levels of trust.\n\n\n\nTrust Level\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nclosed\nNo traffic can come in or out of the container interface.\n\n\noutbound\nOnly outbound connections permitted.\n\n\npeers\nOnly connections to other containers with the same peers interface are permitted. To enforce the peers trust level, you must set the --container-network-ip-range on the container network. The VCH applies a network rule so that container traffic is only allowed over that IP range. If you do not specify an IP range, the container network uses DHCP and there is no way that the VCH can determine whether or not a container at a given IP address is a peer to another container. In this case, the VCH defaults to the open setting, and it treats all connections as peer connections.\n\n\npublished\nOnly connections to published ports permitted.\n\n\nopen\nAll traffic permitted.\n\n\n\n--container-network-firewall port_group_name:trust_level\n\nIf you do not set --container-network-firewall, the default level of trust is published. As a consequence, if you do not set --container-network-firewall, container developers must specify -p 80 in docker run and docker create commands to publish port 80 on a container. In regular Docker, they do not need to specify -p to publish port 80.\nConfigure VCHs to Use Proxy Servers \nIf access to the Internet or to your private image registries requires the use of a proxy server, you must configure a VCH to connect to the proxy server when you deploy it. The proxy is used only when pulling images, and not for any other purpose.\nIMPORTANT: Configuring a VCH to use a proxy server does not configure proxy support on the containers that this VCH runs. Container developers must configure proxy servers on containers when they create them. \n--https-proxy\nShort name: None\nThe address of the HTTPS proxy server through which the VCH accesses image registries when using HTTPS. Specify the address of the proxy server as either an FQDN or an IP address.\n--https-proxy https://proxy_server_address:port\n\n--http-proxy\nShort name: None\nThe address of the HTTP proxy server through which the VCH accesses image registries when using HTTP. Specify the address of the proxy server as either an FQDN or an IP address.\n--http-proxy http://proxy_server_address:port\n\n\nAdvanced Resource Management Options \nYou can set limits on the memory and CPU shares and reservations on the VCH. For information about memory and CPU shares and reservations, see Allocate Memory Resources, and Allocate CPU Resources in the vSphere documentation.\n--memory-reservation\nShort name: --memr\nReserve a quantity of memory for use by the VCH vApp in vCenter Server, or for the VCH resource pool on an ESXi host. This limit also applies to the container VMs that run in the VCH vApp or resource pool. Specify the memory reservation value in MB. If not specified, vic-machine create sets the reservation to 1.\n--memory-reservation 1024\n\n--memory-shares\nShort name: --mems\nSet memory shares on the VCH vApp in vCenter Server, or on the VCH resource pool on an ESXi host.  This limit also applies to the container VMs that run in the VCH vApp or resource pool. Specify the share value as a level or a number, for example high, normal, low, or 163840. If not specified, vic-machine create sets the share to normal.\n--memory-shares low\n\n--cpu-reservation\nShort name: --cpur\nReserve a quantity of CPU capacity for use by the VCH vApp in vCenter Server, or for the VCH resource pool on an ESXi host. This limit also applies to the container VMs that run in the VCH vApp or resource pool.  Specify the CPU reservation value in MHz. If not specified, vic-machine create sets the reservation to 1.\n--cpu-reservation 1024\n\n--cpu-shares\nShort name: --cpus\nSet CPU shares on the VCH vApp in vCenter Server, or on the VCH resource pool on an ESXi host.  This limit also applies to the container VMs that run in the VCH vApp or resource pool. Specify the share value as a level or a number, for example high, normal, low, or 163840. If not specified, vic-machine create sets the share to normal.\n--cpu-shares low\n\n--endpoint-cpu\nShort name: none\nThe number of virtual CPUs for the VCH endpoint VM. The default is 1. Set this option to increase the number of CPUs in the VCH endpoint VM.\nNOTE Always use the --cpu option instead of the --endpoint-cpu option to increase the overall CPU capacity of the VCH vApp, rather than increasing the number of CPUs on the VCH endpoint VM. The --endpoint-cpu option is mainly intended for use by VMware Support.\n--endpoint-cpu number_of_CPUs\n\n--endpoint-memory\nShort name: none\nThe amount of memory for the VCH endpoint VM. The default is 2048MB. Set this option to increase the amount of memory in the VCH endpoint VM if the VCH will pull large container images.\nNOTE With the exception of VCHs that pull large container images, always use the --memory option instead of the --endpoint-memory option to increase the overall amount of memory for the VCH vApp, rather than on the VCH endpoint VM. Use docker create -m to set the memory on container VMs. The --endpoint-memory option is mainly intended for use by VMware Support.\n--endpoint-memory amount_of_memory\n\n\nOther Advanced Options \n--bridge-network-range \nShort name: --bnr\nThe range of IP addresses that additional bridge networks can use when container application developers use docker network create to create new bridge networks. If you do not specify the bridge-network-range option, the IP range for bridge networks is 172.16.0.0/12.\nWhen you specify the bridge network IP range, you specify the IP range as a CIDR. The smallest subnet that you can specify is /16. If you specify an invalid value for --bridge-network-range, vic-machine create fails with an error.\n--bridge-network-range 192.168.100.0/16\n\n\n--base-image-size\nShort name: None\nThe size of the base image from which to create other images. You should not normally need to use this option. Specify the size in GB or MB. The default size is 8GB. Images are thin-provisioned, so they do not usually consume 8GB of space.  \n--base-image-size 4GB\n\n--container-store\nShort name: --cs\nThe container-store option is not enabled. Container VM files are stored in the datastore that you designate as the image store. \n--appliance-iso\nShort name: --ai\nThe path to the ISO image from which the VCH appliance boots. Set this option if you have moved the appliance.iso file to a folder that is not the folder that contains the vic-machine binary or is not the folder from which you are running vic-machine. Include the name of the ISO file in the path.\nNOTE: Do not use the --appliance-iso option to point vic-machine to an --appliance-iso file that is of a different version to the version of vic-machine that you are running.\n--appliance-iso path_to_ISO_file/appliance.iso\n\n--bootstrap-iso\nShort name: --bi\nThe path to the ISO image from which to boot container VMs. Set this option if you have moved the bootstrap.iso file to a folder that is not the folder that contains the vic-machine binary or is not the folder from which you are running vic-machine. Include the name of the ISO file in the path.\nNOTE: Do not use the --bootstrap-iso option to point vic-machine to a --bootstrap-iso file that is of a different version to the version of vic-machine that you are running.\n--bootstrap-iso path_to_ISO_file/bootstrap.iso\n\n--use-rp\nShort name: none\nDeploy the VCH appliance to a resource pool on vCenter Server rather than to a vApp. If you specify this option, vic-machine create creates a resource pool with the same name as the VCH.\n--use-rp\n\n\n--debug \nShort name: -v\nDeploy the VCH with more verbose levels of logging, and optionally modify the behavior of vic-machine for troubleshooting purposes. Specifying the --debug option increases the verbosity of the logging for all aspects of VCH operation, not just deployment. For example, by setting the --debug option, you increase the verbosity of the logging for VCH initialization, VCH services, container VM initialization, and so on. If not specified, the --debug value is set to 1 and verbose logging is enabled.\nNOTE: Do not confuse the vic-machine create --debug option with the vic-machine debug command, that enables access to the VCH endpoint VM. For information about vic-machine debug, see Debugging the VCH. \nWhen you specify vic-machine create --debug, you set a debugging level of 0, 1, 2, or 3. Setting --debug to 2 or 3 changes the behavior of vic-machine create as well as increasing the level of verbosity of the logs:\n\n--debug 0 Disables verbosity in the logs.\n--debug 1 Provides verbosity in the logs, with no other changes to vic-machine behavior. This is the default setting.\n--debug 2 Exposes servers on more interfaces, launches pprof in container VMs.\n--debug 3 Disables recovery logic and logs sensitive data. Disables the restart of failed components and prevents container VMs from shutting down. Logs environment details for user application, and collects application output in the log bundle. This is the maximum  supported debugging level.\n\nAdditionally, deploying a VCH with a --debug 3 enables SSH access to the VCH endpoint VM console by default, with a root password of password, without requiring you to run the vic-machine debug command. This functionality enables you to perform targeted interactive diagnostics in environments in which a VCH endpoint VM failure occurs consistently and in a fashion that prevents vic-machine debug from functioning. \nIMPORTANT: There is no provision for persistently changing the default root password. Only use this configuration for debugging in a secured environment.\n"},"vic_vsphere_admin/vic_env_variables.html":{"url":"vic_vsphere_admin/vic_env_variables.html","title":"Set Environment Variables","keywords":"","body":"Set Environment Variables for Key vic-machine Options\nIf you deploy multiple virtual container hosts (VCHs) to the same vCenter Server instance or ESXi host, you can simplify vic-machine commands by setting environment variables for certain key vic-machine options.\nYou can set environment variables for the following vic-machine options. \n\n\n\nOption\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n--target\nVIC_MACHINE_TARGET\nThe address of the vCenter Server instance or ESXi host on which you are deploying VCHs.\n\n\n--user\nVIC_MACHINE_USER\nThe user name for the vSphere account that you use when running vic-machine commands.

Any container VM traffic that routes through the VCH also uses the public network. If you do not specify the --public-network option, the VCH uses the VM Network for public network traffic.\nYou can direct traffic between ESXi hosts, vCenter Server, and the VCH to a specific network by specifying the --management-network option. If you do not specify the --management-network option, the VCH uses the public network for management traffic.\nYou can designate a specific network for use by the Docker API by specifying the --client-network option. If you do not specify the --client-network option, the Docker API uses the public network.\n\nIMPORTANT: A VCH supports a maximum of 3 distinct network interfaces. Because the bridge network requires its own port group, at least two of the public, client, and management networks must share a network interface and therefore a port group. Container networks do not go through the VCH, so they are not subject to this limitation. This limitation will be removed in a future release.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, datacenter, cluster, image store, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nDirects public and management traffic to network 1 and Docker API traffic to network 2.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--public-network 'network 1'\n--management-network 'network 1'\n--client-network 'network 2'\n--name vch1\n--force\n--no-tls\n\n\nFor more information about the networking options, see the Networking Options section in VCH Deployment Options.\nSet a Static IP Address for the VCH Endpoint VM on the Different Networks \nIf you specify networks for any or all of the public, management, and client networks, you can deploy the VCH so that the VCH endpoint VM has a static IP address on one or more of those networks.  \nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, datacenter, cluster, image store, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nDirects public and management traffic to network 1 and Docker API traffic to network 2.\nSets a DNS server for use by the public, management, and client networks.\nSets a static IP address and subnet mask for the VCH endpoint VM on the public and client networks. Because the management network shares a network with the public network, you only need to specify the public network IP address. You cannot specify a management IP address because you are sharing a port group between the management and public network.\nSpecifies the gateway for the public network. If you set a static IP address on the public network, you must also specify the gateway address.\nDoes not specify a gateway for the client network. It is not necessary to specify a gateway on either of the client or management networks if those networks are L2 adjacent to their gateways.\nBecause this example specifies a static IP address for the VCH endpoint VM on the client network, vic-machine create uses this address as the Common Name with which to create auto-generated trusted certificates. Full TLS authentication is implemented by default, so no TLS options are specified. \n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--public-network 'network 1'\n--public-network-ip 192.168.1.10/24\n--public-network-gateway 192.168.1.1\n--management-network 'network 1'\n--client-network 'network 2'\n--client-network-ip 192.168.3.10/24\n--dns-server dns_server_address\n--force\n--name vch1\n\n\nFor more information about setting static IP addresses, see the Specify a Static IP Address for the VCH Endpoint VM in VCH Deployment Options.\nConfigure a Non-DHCP Network for Container VMs \nYou can designate a specific network for container VMs to use by specifying the --container-network option. Containers use this network if the container developer runs docker run or docker create specifying the --net option with one of the specified container networks when they run or create a container. This option requires a port group that must exist before you run vic-machine create. You cannot use the same port group that you use for the bridge network. You can provide a descriptive name for the network, for use by Docker. If you do not specify a descriptive name, Docker uses the vSphere network name. For example, the descriptive name appears as an available network in the output of docker info and docker network ls. \nIf the network that you designate as the container network in the --container-network option does not support DHCP, you can configure the gateway, DNS server, and a range of IP addresses for container VMs to use.  You must specify --container-network-ip-range if container developers need to deploy containers with static IP addresses. \nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, datacenter, cluster, image store, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nUses the VM Network for the public, management, and client networks.\nDesignates a port group named vic-containers for use by container VMs that are run with the --net option.\nGives the container network the name vic-container-network, for use by Docker. \nSpecifies the gateway, two DNS servers, and a range of IP addresses on the container network for container VMs to use.\nOpens the firewall on the container network for outbound connections.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--container-network vic-containers:vic-container-network\n--container-network-gateway vic-containers:gateway_ip_address/24\n--container-network-dns vic-containers:dns1_ip_address\n--container-network-dns vic-containers:dns2_ip_address\n--container-network-ip-range vic-containers:192.168.100.0/24\n--container-network-firewall vic-containers:outbound\n--name vch1\n--force\n--no-tls\n\n\nFor more information about the container network options, see the --container-network and  Configure Container Networks sections in VCH Deployment Options.\nConfigure a Proxy Server \nIf your network access is controlled by a proxy server, you must   configure a VCH to connect to the proxy server when you deploy it, so that it can pull images from external sources.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, image store, cluster, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nConfigures the VCH to access the network via an HTTPS proxy server.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--https-proxy https://proxy_server_address:port\n--name vch1\n--force\n--no-tls\n\n\n\n\nSpecify Volume Stores \nIf container application developers will use the docker volume create command to create containers that use volumes, you must create volume stores when you deploy VCHs. You specify volume stores in the --volume-store option. You can specify --volume-store multiple times to create multiple volume stores. \nWhen you create a volume store, you specify the name of the datastore to use and an optional path to a folder on that datastore. You also specify a descriptive name for that volume store for use by Docker.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, datacenter, cluster, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nSpecifies the volumes folder on datastore 1 as the default volume store. Creating a volume store named default allows container application developers to create anonymous or named volumes by using docker create -v. \nSpecifies a second volume store named volume_store_2 in the volumes folder on datastore 2. \nSpecifies a volume store named shared_volume in a NFS share point, from which containers can mount shared volumes.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--image-store 'datastore 1'\n--volume-store 'datastore 1'/volumes:default\n--volume-store 'datastore 2'/volumes:volume_store_2\n--volume-store nfs://nfs_store/path/to/share/point:shared_volume\n--name vch1\n--force\n--no-tls\n\n\nFor more information about volume stores, see the volume-store section in VCH Deployment Options. \nSecurity Examples \nThe examples in this section demonstrate how to configure a VCH to use Certificate Authority (CA) certificates to enable TLSVERIFY in your Docker environment, and to allow access to insecure registries of Docker images.\nUse Auto-Generated Trusted CA Certificates \nYou can deploy a VCH that implements two-way authentication with trusted auto-generated TLS certificates that are signed by a CA. \nTo automatically generate a server certificate that can pass client verification, you must specify the Common Name (CN) for the certificate by using the --tls-cname option. The CN should be the FQDN or IP address of the server, or a domain with a wildcard. The CN value must match the name or address that clients will use to connect to the server. You can use the --organization option to add basic descriptive information to the server certificate. This information is visible to clients if they inspect the server certificate.\nIf you specify an existing CA file with which to validate clients, you must also provide an existing server certificate that is compatible with the --tls-cname value or the IP address of the client interface.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user, password, datacenter, image store, cluster, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nProvides a wildcard domain *.example.org as the FQDN for the VCH, for use as the Common Name in the certificate. This assumes that there is a DHCP server offering IP addresses on VM Network, and that those addresses have corresponding DNS entries such as dhcp-a-b-c.example.com.\nSpecifies a folder in which to store the auto-generated certificates.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--tls-cname *.example.org\n--tls-cert-path path_to_cert_folder\n--force\n--name vch1\n\n\nThe Docker API for this VCH will be accessible at https://dhcp-a-b-c.example.com:2376.\nFor more information about using auto-generated CA certificates, see the section Restrict Access to the Docker API with Auto-Generated Certificates in VCH Deployment Options.\nUse Custom Server Certificates \nYou can create a VCH that uses a custom server certificate, for example  a server certificate that has been signed by Verisign or another public root. You use the --tls-server-cert and --tls-server-key options to provide the paths to a custom X.509 certificate and its key when you deploy a VCH. The paths to the certificate and key files must be relative to the location from which you are running vic-machine create.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, image store, cluster, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nProvides the paths relative to the current location of the *.pem files for the custom server certificate and key files.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--tls-server-cert ../some/relative/path/certificate_file.pem\n--tls-server-key ../some/relative/path/key_file.pem\n--name vch1\n--force\n\n\nFor more information about using custom server certificates, see the section Restrict Access to the Docker API with Custom Certificates in VCH Deployment Options.\nCombine Custom Server Certificates and Auto-Generated Client Certificates \nYou can create a VCH with a custom server certificate by specifying the paths to custom server-cert.pem and server-key.pem files in the --tls-server-cert and --tls-server-key options. The key should be un-encrypted. Specifying the --tls-server-cert and --tls-server-key options for the server certificate does not affect the automatic generation of client certificates. If you specify the --tls-cname option to match the common name value of the server certificate, vic-machine create generates self-signed certificates for Docker client authentication and deployment of the VCH succeeds.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, image store, cluster, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nProvides the paths relative to the current location of the *.pem files for the custom server certificate and key files.\nSpecifies the common name from the server certificate in the --tls-cname option. The --tls-cname option is used in this case to ensure that the certificate is valid for the resulting VCH, given the network configuration.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--tls-server-cert ../some/relative/path/certificate_file.pem\n--tls-server-key ../some/relative/path/key_file.pem\n--tls-cname cname_from_server_cert\n--name vch1\n--force\n\n\nSpecify Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation \nWhen you deploy a VCH, you can use different vSphere user accounts for deployment and for operation. This allows you to run VCHs with lower levels of privileges than are required for deployment.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the image store and name for the VCH.\nSpecifies vsphere_admin in the --target option, to identify the user account with vSphere Administrator privileges with which to deploy the VCH.\nSpecifies vsphere_user and its password in the --ops-user and --ops-password options, to identify the user account with which the VCH runs. The user account that you specify in --ops-user must  is different to the vSphere Administrator account that you use for deployment, and must exist before you deploy the VCH. \nSpecifies a resource pool in which to deploy the VCH in the --compute-resource option.\nSpecifies the VCH port groups in the --bridge-network and --container-network options.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target vsphere_admin:vsphere_admin_password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1/VCH_pool\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--container-network vic-containers:vic-container-network\n--name vch1\n--ops-user vsphere_user\n--ops-password vsphere_user_password\n--force\n--no-tls\n\n\nFor information about the permissions that the --ops-user account requires, and the permissions to set on the resource pool for the VCH and on the network folders, see Use Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation.\nRegistry Server Examples \nThe examples in this section demonstrate how to configure a VCH to use a private registry server, for example vSphere Integrated Containers Registry.\nAuthorize Access to an Insecure Private Registry Server \nTo authorize connections from a VCH to a private registry server without verifying the certificate of that registry, set the --insecure-registry option. If you authorize a VCH to connect to an insecure private registry server, the VCH attempts to access the registry server via HTTP if access via HTTPS fails. VCHs always use HTTPS when connecting to registry servers for which you have not authorized insecure access. You can specify insecure-registry multiple times to allow connections from the VCH to multiple insecure private registry servers.\nNOTE: You cannot configure VCHs to connect to vSphere Integrated Containers Registry instances as insecure registries. Connections to vSphere Integrated Containers Registry always require HTTPS and a certificate.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, image store, cluster, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nAuthorizes the VCH to pull Docker images from the insecure private registry servers located at the URLs registry_URL_1 and registry_URL_2.\nThe registry server at registry_URL_2 listens for connections on port 5000. \n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--insecure-registry registry_URL_1\n--insecure-registry registry_URL_2:5000\n--name vch1\n--force\n--no-tls\n\n\nFor more information about configuring VCHs to allow connections to insecure private registry servers, see the section on the insecure-registry option in VCH Deployment Options.\nAuthorize Access to Secure Registries and vSphere Integrated Containers Registry \nFor an example of how to use --registry-ca to authorize access to vSphere Integrated Containers Registry or to another secure registry, see Deploy a VCH for Use with vSphere Integrated Containers Registry.\n"},"vic_vsphere_admin/deploy_vch_registry.html":{"url":"vic_vsphere_admin/deploy_vch_registry.html","title":"Deploy a VCH for Use with vSphere Integrated Containers Registry","keywords":"","body":"Deploy a VCH for Use with vSphere Integrated Containers Registry\nTo use vSphere Integrated Containers Engine with vSphere Integrated Containers Registry, you must obtain the registry certificate and pass it to a virtual container host (VCH) when you create that VCH.\nIf you did not provide a custom server certificate and private key for the registry to the OVA installer when you deployed the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance, vSphere Integrated Containers Registry auto-generates a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate, a server certificate, and a server private key.

Deployment of a VCH requires a user account with vSphere Administrator privileges. \nDay-to-day operation of a VCH requires fewer permissions than  deployment. You can configure a VCH so that it uses different user accounts for deployment and for operation by using the vic-machine create --ops-user and --ops-password options when you deploy the VCH. By specifying --ops-user, you can limit the post-deployment permissions of the VCH to only those vSphere operations that it needs. If you do not specify --ops-user, the VCH runs with full vSphere Administrator privileges.\nAfter deployment, a VCH must have permission to perform the following operations:\n\nCreate, modify, and delete VMs within its resource pool\nReconfigure the endpoint VM\nValidate host firewall configuration and system licenses\n\nWhen you deploy a VCH, a user account that you specify in --ops-user must have the correct privileges to allow the VCH to perform these operations. vSphere Integrated Containers Engine does not currently create the required roles, so to assign privileges to the --ops-user user account, you must manually create user roles in vSphere before you deploy the VCH. You assign  privileges to those roles, and assign the roles to the user account to use in --ops-user. \nProcedure\n\nIn the vSphere Web Client, create a user group, for example VIC Ops Users, and add the appropriate user accounts to the user group.\nThe best practice when assigning roles in vSphere is to assign the roles to user groups and then to add users to those groups, rather than assigning roles to the users directly.\n\nGo to Administration > Roles and create one role for each type of inventory object that VCHs need to access.\nIt is possible to create a single role, but by creating multiple roles you keep the privileges of the VCH as granular as possible.\n\n\n\nRole to Create\nRequired Permissions\n\n\n\n\nVCH - vcenter\nDatastore > Configure datastore\n\n\nVCH - datacenter\nDatastore > Configure datastoreDatastore > Low level file operations\n\n\nVCH - datastore\nDatastore > AllocateSpaceDatastore > Browse datastore Datastore > Configure datastoreDatastore > Remove fileDatastore > Low level file operationsHost > Configuration > System management\n\n\nVCH - network\nNetwork > Assign network\n\n\nVCH - endpoint\ndvPort group > Modify\ndvPort group > Policy operation\ndvPort group > Scope operation\nvApp > Add virtual machine\nVirtualMachine > Configuration > Add existing disk\nVirtualMachine > Configuration > Add new disk\nVirtualMachine > Configuration > Add or remove device\nVirtualMachine > Configuration > Advanced\nVirtualMachine > Configuration > Modify device settings\nVirtualMachine > Configuration > Remove disk\nVirtualMachine > Configuration > Rename\nVirtualMachine > Guest operations > Guest operation program execution\nVirtualMachine > Interaction > Device connection\nVirtualMachine > Interaction > Power off\nVirtualMachine > Interaction > Power on\nVirtualMachine > Inventory > Create new\nVirtualMachine > Inventory > Remove\nVirtualMachine > Inventory > Register\nVirtualMachine > Inventory > Unregister\n\n\n\nFor information about how to create vSphere roles, see vSphere Permissions and User Management Tasks in the vSphere documentation. \n\nGo to Networking, create a network folder, and place the distributed virtual switches that the VCHs will use for the bridge network and any container networks into that folder.\nThe parent object of distributed virtual switches that the VCH uses  as the bridge network and container networks must be set to Read-Only, with Propagate to Children enabled. By placing distributed virtual switches in a network folder, you avoid setting an entire datacenter to Read-Only. This restriction only applies to the bridge network and container networks. When you specify the vic-machine create --bridge-network and --container-network options, include the full inventory path to the networks in the following format:datacenter/network/network_folder/port_group_name\n\n(Optional) Go to Hosts and Clusters and create a resource pool in which to deploy VCHs.\nBy creating a resource pool for VCHs, you can set the correct permissions on just that resource pool rather than on an entire host or cluster. You specify this resource pool in the vic-machine create --compute-resource option when you deploy the VCH. For a more granular application of privileges, you can also apply the permissions directly to VCH vApps after deployment, rather than to a resource pool.\n\nIn each of the Hosts and Clusters, Storage, and Networking views, select inventory objects and assign the user group and the appropriate role to each one.\n\n\n\nInventory Object\nRole to Assign\nPropagate\n\n\n\n\nTop-level vCenter Server instance\nVCH - vcenter\nNo\n\n\nDatacenters\nVCH - datacenter\nNo\n\n\nClusters.

The VCH endpoint VM does not need to be running for vMotion to occur on the container VMs. Clusters with a mix of container VMs and non-container VMs can use vMotion with fully automated DRS. \nVMware vSphere High Availability \nYou can apply vSphere High Availability to clusters on which VCHs and container VMs run. If the host on which a VCH or container VMs are running goes offline, the VCH and container VMs migrate to another host in the cluster. VCHs restart on the new host immediately. Container VMs that were running before the migration restart one by one, after the VCH has restarted.\nVMware NSX \nYou can deploy the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance on an NSX network. VCHs require distributed port groups and a bridge network. You can deploy VCHs to NSX networks if those networks are configured to provide distributed port groups. You can use NSX networks for the management, bridge, public, and container networks. \nMaintenance Mode \nIn a cluster with fully automated DRS, if you put a host into maintenance mode, DRS migrates the VCHs and container VMs to another host in the cluster. Putting hosts into maintenance mode requires manual intervention in certain circumstances:\n\nIf VCHs and container VMs are running on a standalone ESXi host, you must power off the VCHs and container VMs before you put the host into maintenance mode.\nIf container VMs have active docker attach sessions, you cannot put the host into maintenance mode until the attach sessions end. \n\nVMware vSAN \nVCHs maintain file system layers inherent in container images by mapping to discrete VMDK files, all of which can be housed in shared vSphere datastores, including vSAN, NFS, Fibre Channel, and iSCSI datastores.\nEnhanced Linked Mode Environments \nYou can deploy VCHs in Enhanced Linked Mode environments. Any vCenter Server instance in the Enhanced Linked Mode environment can access VCH and container VM information.\nvSphere Features Not Supported in This Release \nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine does not currently support the following vSphere features:\n\nvSphere Storage DRS™: You cannot configure VCHs to use Storage DRS datastore clusters. However, you can specify the path to a specific datastore within a Storage DRS datastore cluster by specifying the full inventory path to the datastore in the vic-machine create --image-store option. For example, --image-store /dc1/datastore/my-storage-pod/datastore1. You can also specify the relative path from a datastore folder in a datacenter, for example --image-store my-storage-pod/datastore1.\nvSphere Fault Tolerance: vSphere Integrated Containers does not implement vSphere Fault Tolerance. However, VCH processes that stop unexpectedly do restart automatically, independently of vSphere Fault Tolerance.\nvSphere Virtual Volumes™: You cannot use Virtual Volumes as the target datastores for image stores or volume stores.\nSnapshots: Creating and reverting to snapshots of the VCH endpoint VM or container VMs can cause vSphere Integrated Containers Engine not to function correctly.\n\n"},"vic_vsphere_admin/vch_admin_client.html":{"url":"vic_vsphere_admin/vch_admin_client.html","title":"VCH Admin in the vSphere Client","keywords":"","body":"Virtual Container Host Administration in the vSphere Client\nvSphere Integrated Containers provides a basic plug-in for the Flex-based vSphere Web Client on vCenter Server 6.0 or 6.5. vSphere Integrated Containers provides a plug-in with more complete functionality for the HTML5 vSphere Client.

In addition to these options, the vic-machine configure command provides options that allow you to perform the following modifications on VCHs:\n\nUpdate vCenter Server Credentials\nUpdate vCenter Server Certificates\nAdd or Update Registry Server Certificates\nUpdate Security Configuration\nAdd Volume Stores\nAdd and Reset DNS Servers\nConfigure Container Network Settings\nAdd, Configure, or Remove Proxy Servers\nConfigure Debug Mode\nConfigure CPU and Memory Allocations\nReset Upgrade or Configuration Progress\n\nTo see the current configuration of a VCH before you configure it, and to check the new configuration,  run vic-machine inspect config before and after you run vic-machine configure. For information about running vic-machine inspect config, see Obtain VCH Configuration Information. \nIMPORTANT: Running vic-machine inspect config before you run vic-machine configure is especially important if you are adding registry certificates, volume stores, DNS servers, or container networks to a VCH that already includes one or more of those elements. When you add registry certificates, volume stores, DNS servers, or container networks to a VCH, you must specify the existing configuration as well as any new configurations in separate instances of the appropriate vic-machine inspect config option. \nUpdate vCenter Server Credentials \nIf the vCenter Server credentials change after the deployment of a VCH, you must update that VCH with the new credentials. The VCH will not function until you update the credentials. \nYou provide the new vCenter Server credentials in the vic-machine configure --ops-user and --ops-password options. You use the vic-machine configure --ops-user and --ops-password options to update the credentials even if you did not specify the vic-machine create --ops-user and --ops-password options during the initial deployment of the VCH. If you did not specify vic-machine create --ops-user and --ops-password during the deployment of the VCH, by default the VCH uses the values from vic-machine create --user and --password for the --ops-user and --ops-password settings, and it uses these credentials for day-to-day, post-deployment operation. \nFor example, if you specified --user Administrator@vsphere.local in the vic-machine create command, and you did not set the vic-machine create --ops-user and --ops-password options, the VCH automatically sets --ops-user to Administrator@vsphere.local and uses this account for post-deployment operations. Consequently, if the password for Administrator@vsphere.local changes, you must specify the vic-machine configure --ops-user and --ops-password options to update the password. This example specifies the --user and --password options to log into vCenter Server, and then specifies --ops-user and --ops-password to update those settings in the VCH. \n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_address\n    --user Administrator@vsphere.local\n    --password password\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --ops-user Administrator@vsphere.local\n    --ops-password new_password\n\nYou can also use the vic-machine configure --ops-user and --ops-password options to configure an operations user on a VCH that was not initially deployed with that option. Similarly, you can use --ops-user and --ops-password to change the operations user account on a VCH that was deployed with an operations user account, or to update the password for a previously specified operations user account. This example specifies the credentials to log into vCenter Server in the --target option, rather than in --user and --password.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --ops-user new_operations_user_account\n    --ops-password password\n\nUpdate vCenter Server Certificates \nIf the vCenter Server certificate changes, you must update any VCHs running on that vCenter Server instance, otherwise they will no longer function.\nTo update the certificate, provide the new certificate thumbprint to the VCH in the --thumbprint option:\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --id vch_id\n    --thumbprint new_certificate_thumbprint\n\nNOTE: If you run vic-machine configure with the --force option and you do not specify --thumbprint, vic-machine updates the thumbprint automatically.\nAdd or Update Registry Server Certificates \nIf a VCH requires access to a new vSphere Integrated Containers Registry instance, or to another private registry, you can add new registry CA certificates by using the vic-machine configure --registry-ca option. You also use the vic-machine configure --registry-ca option if the certificate for an existing registry changes.\nThe vic-machine configure --registry-ca option functions in the same way as the equivalent vic-machine create --registry-ca option. For information about the vic-machine create --registry-ca option, see Private Registry Options in VCH Deployment Options.\nThis example updates the certificate for a registry that this VCH already uses.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --registry-ca path_to_new_ca_cert_for_existing_registry\n\nIf you are adding registry certificates to a VCH that already has one or more registry certificates, you must also specify each existing registry certificate in a separate instance of --registry-ca. This example passes the CA certificate for a new registry to a VCH and specifies the existing certificate for a registry that this VCH already uses.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --registry-ca path_to_ca_cert_for_existing_registry\n    --registry-ca path_to_ca_cert_for_new_registry\n\nNOTE: Unlike vic-machine create, the vic-machine configure command does not provide an --insecure-registry option.\nUpdate Security Configuration  \nYou can configure the security settings of a VCH by using the different TLS options of the vic-machine configure command.\n\nTo configure TLS authentication with automatically generated certificates on a VCH that currently implements no TLS authentication, or to regenerate automatically generated certificates, use the vic-machine configure --tls-cname option.\nTo configure TLS authentication with custom certificates on a VCH that currently implements no TLS authentication, or that uses automatically generated certificates, or to replace existing custom certificates, use the vic-machine configure --tls-server-cert and --tls-server-key options. \nTo disable verification of client certificates, use the vic-machine configure --no-tlsverify option.\nTo change the location in which to search for and store certificates, use the vic-machine configure --tls-cert-path option.\n\nThe vic-machine configure TLS options function in the same way as the equivalent vic-machine create options. For information about the vic-machine create security options, see Security Options in VCH Deployment Options.\nNOTE: The vic-machine configure command does not include an equivalent to vic-machine create --tls-ca option.\nThis example  sets the vic-machine configure --tls-cname option to  implement TLS authentication with automatically generated server and client certificates. Before the configuration, the VCH either has no authentication or uses automatically generated certificates that you want to regenerate. The --tls-cert-path option specifies the folder in which to store the generated certificate.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --tls-cname *.example.com\n    --tls-cert-path path_to_cert_folder\n\nThis example  uses the vic-machine configure --tls-server-cert and --tls-server-key options to implement TLS authentication with custom certificates. Before the configuration, the VCH either has no TLS authentication, or it uses automatically generated certificates, or it uses custom certificates that require replacement. \n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --tls-server-cert path_to_cert/certificate_name.pem\n    --tls-server-key path_to_key/key_name.pem\n\nThis example sets --no-tlsverify to disable the verification of client certificates on a VCH that implements client and server authentication.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --no-tlsverify\n\nAdd Volume Stores \nYou can add volume stores to VCHs by using the vic-machine configure --volume-store option. You can add vSphere datastores and NFS datastores with shared mount points to a VCH. \nThe vic-machine configure --volume-store option functions in the same way as the equivalent vic-machine create --volume-store option. For information about the vic-machine create --volume-store option, see --volume-store in VCH Deployment Options.\nIf you are adding volume stores to a VCH that already has one or more volume stores, you must specify each existing volume store in a separate instance of --volume-store.\nThis example adds a new NFS volume store to a VCH. The VCH already has an existing volume store with the label default, that is backed by a vSphere datastore.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --volume-store datastore_name/datastore_path:default\n    --volume-store nfs://datastore_name/path_to_share_point:nfs_volume_store_label\n\nNOTE: The current version of vSphere Integrated Containers does not allow you to remove volume stores from a VCH.\nAdd and Reset DNS Servers \nIf you deployed the VCH with a static IP address, you can add DNS servers or reset them to the default by using the vic-machine configure --dns-server option. \nThe vic-machine configure --dns-server option functions in the same way as the equivalent vic-machine create --dns-server option. For information about the vic-machine create --dns-server option, see  --dns-server in VCH Deployment Options.\nIf  you are adding DNS servers to a VCH that already includes one or more DNS servers, you must also specify each existing DNS server in a separate instance of --dns-server. This example adds a new DNS server, dns_server_2, to a VCH that already uses dns_server_1.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --dns-server dns_server_1\n    --dns-server dns_server_2\n\nTo reset the DNS servers on a VCH to the default, set the vic-machine configure --dns-server option to \"\".\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --dns-server \"\"\n\nNOTE: The vic-machine configure command does not include options to set a static IP address on a VCH that uses DHCP.\nConfigure Container Network Settings \nIf containers that run in a VCH require a dedicated network for external communication, you can add one or more container networks to the VCH by using the vic-machine configure --container-network options. You can specify --container-network multiple times to add multiple container networks.\nThe vic-machine configure --container-network options function in the same way as the equivalent vic-machine create options. For information about the vic-machine create container network options, see the description of the --container-network option and Configure Container Networks in VCH Deployment Options.\nThis example adds a new container network to a VCH. It designates a port group named vic-containers for use by container VMs, gives the container network the name vic-container-network for use by Docker, specifies the gateway, two DNS servers, and a range of IP addresses on the container network for container VMs to use.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --container-network vic-containers:vic-container-network\n    --container-network-gateway vic-containers:gateway_ip_address/24\n    --container-network-ip-range vic-containers:192.168.100.0/24\n    --container-network-dns vic-containers:dns1_ip_address\n    --container-network-dns vic-containers:dns2_ip_address\n\nIf  you are adding container networks to a VCH that already includes one or more container networks, you must also specify each existing container network in separate instances of the --container-network options. This example adds a new DHCP container network named vic-containers-2 to the VCH from the example above.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --container-network vic-containers:vic-container-network\n    --container-network-gateway vic-containers:gateway_ip_address/24\n    --container-network-ip-range vic-containers:192.168.100.0/24\n    --container-network-dns vic-containers:dns1_ip_address\n    --container-network-dns vic-containers:dns2_ip_address\n    --container-network vic-containers-2:vic-container-network-2\n\nYou can also configure the trust level of the container network firewall by setting the --container-network-firewall option. This example opens the firewall for outbound connections on the two container networks from the preceding examples.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --container-network vic-containers:vic-container-network\n    --container-network-gateway vic-containers:gateway_ip_address/24\n    --container-network-ip-range vic-containers:192.168.100.0/24\n    --container-network-dns vic-containers:dns1_ip_address\n    --container-network-dns vic-containers:dns2_ip_address\n    --container-network-firewall vic-containers:outbound\n    --container-network vic-containers-2:vic-container-network-2\n    --container-network-firewall vic-containers-2:outbound\n\nFor information about the trust levels that you can set, see --container-network-firewall in VCH Deployment Options.\nYou cannot modify or delete an existing container network on a VCH. \nAdd, Configure, or Remove Proxy Servers \nIf access to the Internet or to private registry servers changes to pass through a proxy server, you configure a VCH to use the new proxy server by using the vic-machine configure --https-proxy and --http-proxy options.  You also use the vic-machine configure --https-proxy and --http-proxy options if an existing proxy server changes.\nThe vic-machine configure --https-proxy and --http-proxy options function in the same way as the equivalent vic-machine create options. For information about the vic-machine create --https-proxy and --http-proxy options, see Configure VCHs to Use Proxy Servers in VCH Deployment Options.\nThis example configures a VCH to use a new HTTPS proxy server.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --https-proxy https://new_proxy_server_address:port\n\nTo remove a proxy server from a VCH, set the vic-machine configure --https-proxy or --http-proxy options to \"\".\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --https-proxy \"\"\n\nConfigure Debug Mode  \nTo enable or disable debug mode on a VCH, you use the vic-machine configure --debug option. You can also use vic-machine configure --debug to increase or decrease the level of debugging on a VCH that is already running in debug mode. \nThe vic-machine configure --debug option functions in the same way as the equivalent vic-machine create --debug option. For information about the vic-machine create --debug option, see --debug in VCH Deployment Options. By default, vic-machine create deploys VCHs with debugging level 1.\nThis example increases the level of debugging to level 3, either on a VCH that is running with a lower level of debugging, or on a VCH that is not running in debug mode.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --debug 3\n\nThis example sets the --debug option to 0, to disable debug mode on a VCH. \n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --debug 0\n\n\nConfigure CPU and Memory Allocations \nIf a VCH requires more resources, or if it consumes too many resources, you can configure CPU and memory allocations on the VCH vApp by using the different vic-machine configure --memory and --cpu options.\nThe vic-machine configure options for memory and CPU allocations function in the same way as the equivalent vic-machine create options. For information about the vic-machine create --cpu and --memory options, see General Deployment Options in VCH Deployment Options. For information about the memory and CPU reservation and shares options, see Advanced Resource Management Options.\nThis example configures a VCH to impose memory and CPU reservations, limits, and shares.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --memory 1024\n    --memory-reservation 1024\n    --memory-shares low\n    --cpu 1024\n    --cpu-reservation 1024\n    --cpu-shares low\n\n\nNOTE: If you set limits on memory and CPU usage that are too low, the vic-machine configure operation might fail because it is unable to restart the VCH.\nThis example removes all limitations on memory and CPU use from a VCH.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --memory 0\n    --memory-reservation 0\n    --memory-shares normal\n    --cpu 0\n    --cpu-reservation 0\n    --cpu-shares normal\n\n\nReset Upgrade or Configuration Progress \nIf an attempt to upgrade or configure a VCH was interrupted before it could complete successfully, any further attempts to run vic-machine upgrade or vic-machine configure fail with the error another upgrade/configure operation is in progress. This happens because vic-machine upgrade and vic-machine configure set an UpdateInProgress flag on the VCH endpoint VM that prevents other operations on that VCH while the upgrade or configuration operation is ongoing. If an upgrade or configuration operation is interrupted before it completes, this flag persists on the VCH indefinitely.\nTo clear the flag so that you can attempt further vic-machine upgrade or vic-machine configure operations, run vic-machine configure with the --reset-progress option.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system configure\n    --target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n    --thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n    --id vch_id\n    --reset-progress\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Before you run vic-machine configure --reset-progress, check in Recent Tasks in the vSphere Client that there are indeed no update or configuration operations in progress on the VCH endoint VM.\n"},"vic_vsphere_admin/remove_vch.html":{"url":"vic_vsphere_admin/remove_vch.html","title":"Delete VCHs","keywords":"","body":"Delete Virtual Container Hosts\nYou delete virtual container hosts (VCHs) by using the vic-machine delete command.\nThe vic-machine delete includes one option in addition to the Common vic-machine Options, --force.\n\nYou must specify the username and optionally the password, either in the --target option or separately in the --user and --password options. \nIf the VCH has a name other than the default name, virtual-container-host, you must specify the --name or --id option. \nIf multiple compute resources exist in the datacenter, you must specify the --compute-resource or --id option.\nSpecifying the --force option forces vic-machine delete to ignore warnings and continue with the deletion of a VCH. Any running container VMs and any volume stores associated with the VCH are deleted. Errors such as an incorrect compute resource still cause the deletion to fail. \n\nIf you do not specify --force and the VCH contains running container VMs, the deletion fails with a warning. \nIf you do not specify --force and the VCH has volume stores, the deletion of the VCH succeeds without deleting the volume stores. The list of volume stores appears in the vic-machine delete success message for reference and optional manual removal.\n\n\nIf your vSphere environment uses untrusted, self-signed certificates, you must also specify the thumbprint of the vCenter Server instance or ESXi host in the --thumbprint option, or specify --force. To obtain the thumbprint of the vCenter Server or ESXi host certificate, run vic-machine without the specifying the --thumbprint or --force options. The deletion of the VCH fails, but the resulting error message includes the required certificate thumbprint. You can copy the thumbprint from the error message and run vic-machine again, including the --thumbprint option.\n   NOTE: If you obtain the thumbprint by other means, use upper-case letters and colon delimitation in the thumbprint. Do not use space delimitation.\n\n\nWhen you delete a VCH that uses TLS authentication with trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates, vic-machine delete does not delete the certificates or the certificate folder, even if you specify the --force option. Because vic-machine delete does not delete the certificates, you can delete VCHs and create new ones that reuse the same certificates. This is useful if you have already distributed the client certificates for VCHs that you need to recreate.\nThe vic-machine delete command does not modify the firewall on ESXi hosts. If you do not need to deploy or run further VCHs on the ESXi host or cluster after you have deleted VCHs, run vic-machine update firewall --deny to close port 2377 on the host or hosts. \nExample\nThe following example includes the options required to remove a VCH from a simple vCenter Server environment. \n  $ vic-machine-operating_system delete\n--target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n--thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n--name vch_name\n\nIf your vSphere environment uses untrusted, self-signed certificates, running vic-machine delete with the --force option allows you to omit the --thumbprint option.\n$ vic-machine-operating_system delete\n--target vcenter_server_username:password@vcenter_server_address\n--name vch_name\n--force\n\nOutput\nIf the delete operation fails with a message about container VMs that are powered on, run docker stop on the containers and run vic-machine delete again. Alternatively, run vic-machine delete with the --force option.\nCAUTION Running vic-machine delete with the --force option removes all running container VMs that the VCH manages, as well as any associated volumes and volume stores.

A replication rule identifies an endpoint registry to which to replicate images. \n\nWhen you first enable a replication rule, all of the images in the project replicate to the endpoint registry. \nIf the project does not already exist on the remote registry, the rule creates a new project automatically.  \nAfter the initial synchronization between the registries, images that users push to the project on the source registry replicate incrementally to the endpoint registry. \nIf users delete images from the source registry, the replication rule deletes the image from the endpoint registry.\nReplication rules are unidirectional. To establish two-way replication, so that users can push images to either project and keep the projects in sync, you must create replication rules in both registry instances.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nYou have two vSphere Integrated Containers Registry instances, one that contains the images to replicate and one to act as the replication endpoint registry.\nYou created at least one project, and pushed at least one image to that project.\nIf the remote registry that you intend to use as the endpoint uses a self-signed or an untrusted certificate, you must disable certificate verification on the registry from which you are replicating. For example, disable certificate verification if the endpoint registry uses the default auto-generated certificates that vSphere Integrated Containers Registry created during the deployment of the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance. For information about disabling certificate verification, see Configure System Settings.\n\nProcedure\n\nGo to http://vic_appliance_address, click the link to Go to the vSphere Integrated Containers Management Portal, and enter the vCenter Server Single Sign-On credentials. \nUse an account with Cloud Administrator privileges.\n\nSelect the Administration tab, click Projects on the left,  and click the name of the project to replicate.\nClick Replication, then click the + Replication Rule button.\nEnter a suitable name for the new replication rule and optionally add a description.\nSelect or create an endpoint registry.\n\nTo select an existing endpoint registry, select an endpoint from the Endpoint Name drop-down menu.\nWhen you select an existing endpoint registry, the URL, user name and password are filled in automatically. If only one endpoint registry exists in the system, it is selected automatically. \n\nTo create a new endpoint, check the New Endpoint check box.\n\nEnter a suitable name for the new replication endpoint.\nEnter the full URL of the vSphere Integrated Containers Registry instance to set up as a replication endpoint.\nFor example, https://registry_address:443.\n\nEnter the user name and password for the endpoint registry instance. \nUse the admin account for that vSphere Integrated Containers Registry instance, an account with Administrator privileges on that instance, or an account that has write permission on the corresponding project in the endpoint registry. If the project already exists and the replication user that you configure in the rule does not have write privileges in the target project, the replication fails. \n\n\n\n\n\nClick Test Connection.\n\nWhen you have successfully tested the connection, optionally check the Enable checkbox, and click OK.\nIf you select Enable, replication starts immediately. You can track the progress of the replication in the list of Replication Jobs.\n\nClick the icon in the Logs column for the replication job to check that replication succeeded without errors.\n\nResult\nDepending on the size of the images and the speed of the network connection, replication might take some time to complete. An image is not available in the endpoint registry until all of its layers have been synchronized from the source registry. If a replication job fails due to a network issue, vSphere Integrated Containers Registry reschedules the job to retry it a few minutes later.\n"},"vic_cloud_admin/manage_replication_endpoints.html":{"url":"vic_cloud_admin/manage_replication_endpoints.html","title":"Manage Replication Endpoints","keywords":"","body":"Manage Replication Endpoints and Rules\nYou can list, add, edit and delete replication endpoints and replication rules, depending on certain circumstances. \n\nYou cannot edit or delete replication endpoints that are the targets for replication rules. \nYou cannot edit replication rules that are enabled. \nYou cannot delete replication rules that have running jobs.

You can use links to enable communication between multiple services in your application. Links in vSphere Integrated Containers are similar to Docker links, but connect containers across hosts. A link consists of two parts: a service name and an alias. The service name is the name of the service or template being called. The alias is the hostname that you use to communicate with that service.\nFor example, if you have an application that contains a Web and database service and you define a link in the Web service to the database service by using an alias of my-db, the Web service application opens a TCP connection to my-db:PORT_OF_DB. The PORT_OF_DB is the port that the database listens to, regardless of the public port that is assigned to the host by the container settings. If MySQL is checking for updates on its default 3306 port, and the published port for the container host is 32799, the Web application accesses the database at my-db:3306.\nYou can use networks instead of links. Links are a legacy Docker feature with significant limitations when linking container clusters, including:\n\nDocker does not support multiple links with the same alias. \nYou cannot update the links of a container runtime.

This configuration is commonly referred to as tlsverify in documentation about containers and Docker. You must obtain a copy of the client certificate that was either used or generated when the vSphere administrator deployed the VCH. You can provide the client certificate to the Docker client in either of the following ways:\nBy using the --tlsverify, --tlscert, and --tlskey options when you run Docker commands. You must also add --tlscacert if the server certificate is signed by a custom Certificate Authority (CA). For example:docker -H vch_address:2376 \n--tlsverify \n--tlscert=path_to_client_cert/cert.pem \n--tlskey=path_to_client_key/key.pem \n--tlscacert=path/ca.pem \ninfo\nBy setting Docker environment variables:DOCKER_CERT_PATH=client_certificate_path/cert.pem\nDOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1\n\n\nIf the VCH uses server certificates but does not authenticate the Docker client, no client certificate is required and any client can connect to the VCH. This configuration is commonly referred to as no-tlsverify in documentation about containers and Docker. In this configuration, the VCH has a server certificate and connections are encrypted, requiring you to run Docker commands with the --tls option. For example:docker -H vch_address:2376 --tls infoIn this case, do not set the DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY environment variable. Setting DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY to 0 or to false has no effect.\nIf TLS is completely disabled on the VCH, you connect to the VCH at vch_address:2375. Any Docker client can connect to the VCH and communications are not encrypted. As a consequence, you do not need to specify any additional TLS options in Docker commands or set any environment variables. This configuration is not recommended in production environments. For example:docker -H vch_address:2375 info\n\nUsing Docker Environment Variables \nIf the vSphere administrator deploys the VCHs with TLS authentication, vic-machine create generates a file named vch_name.env.

The vSphere administrator must also have configured the VCH to access the registry.  \nFor information about how to obtain the CA certificate from vSphere Integrated Containers Registry and how to deploy a VCH so that it can access a private registry, see Deploy a VCH for Use with vSphere Integrated Containers Registry.\nThe level of security of the connection between the Docker client and the VCH is independent from the level of security of the connection between the Docker client and the registry. Connections between the Docker client and the registry can be secure while connections between the Docker client and the VCH are insecure, and the reverse. \nNOTE: VCHs cannot to connect to vSphere Integrated Containers Registry instances as insecure registries. Connections to vSphere Integrated Containers Registry always require HTTPS and a certificate.\nDocker on Linux\n$ sudo su\n2.

When the vSphere administrator creates a VCH, they can specify a vSphere datastore or NFS share point to use to store container volumes.

If you do not specify --name, docker volume create assigns a random UUID to the volume.\n\nIf the vSphere administrator created the VCH with one or more volume stores, but none of the volume stores are named default, you must specify the name of an existing volume store in the --opt VolumeStore option. If you do not specify --opt VolumeStore, docker volume create searches for a volume store named default, and returns an error if no such volume store exists. \n  docker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls volume create \n--opt VolumeStore=volume_store_label \n--name volume_name\n\nIf the vSphere administrator created the VCH with a volume store named default, you do not need to specify --opt VolumeStore in the docker volume create command. If you do not specify a volume store name, the docker volume create command automatically uses the default volume store if it exists.\n  docker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls volume create \n--name volume_name\n\nYou can optionally set the capacity of a volume by specifying the --opt Capacity option when you run docker volume create. If you do not specify the --opt Capacity option, the volume is created with the default capacity of 1024MB. \n  If you do not specify a unit for the capacity, the default unit will be in Megabytes.\n  docker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls volume create \n--opt VolumeStore=volume_store_label \n--opt Capacity=2048\n--name volume_name\n\nTo create a volume with a capacity in megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes, include MB, GB, or TB in the value that you pass to --opt Capacity. The unit is case insensitive.\n  docker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls volume create \n--opt VolumeStore=volume_store_label \n--opt Capacity=10GB\n--name volume_name\n\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine currently only supports ext4 file systems for volumes.\n\n\nAfter you create a volume by using docker volume create, you can mount that volume in a container by running either of the following commands:\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \ncreate -v volume_name:/folder busybox\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \nrun -v volume_name:/folder busybox\n\nIn the examples above, Docker mounts the volume volume_name to /folder in the container.\nNOTE: When using a vSphere Integrated Containers Engine VCH as your Docker endpoint, the storage driver is always the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Backend Engine. If you specify the docker volume create --driver option an error stating that a bad driver has been selected will occur.\nCreating Volumes from Images \nSome images, for example, mongo or redis:alpine, contain volume bind information in their metadata. vSphere Integrated Containers Engine creates such volumes with the default parameters and treats them as anonymous volumes. vSphere Integrated Containers Engine treats all volume mount paths as unique, in the same way that Docker does. This should be kept in mind if you attempt to bind other volumes to the same location as anonymous or image volumes. A specified volume always takes priority over an anonymous volume.\nIf you require an image volume with a different volume capacity to the default, create a named volume with the required capacity. You can mount that named volume to the location that the image metadata specifies. You can find the location by running docker inspect image_name and consulting the Volumes section of the output. The resulting container has the required storage capacity and the endpoint.  \nCreate a Container with a New Anonymous or Named Volume \nIf you intend to create named or anonymous volumes by using docker create -v when creating containers, a volume store named default must exist in the VCH. \nNOTES: \n\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine does not support mounting  vSphere datastore folders as data volumes. A command such as docker create -v /folder_name:/folder_name busybox is not supported if the volume store is a vSphere datastore.\nIf you use docker create -v to create containers and mount new volumes on them, vSphere Integrated Containers Engine only supports the -r and -rw options.\n\nCreate a Container with a New Anonymous Volume\nTo create an anonymous volume, you include the path to the destination at which you want to mount the anonymous volume in the docker create -v command. Docker creates the anonymous volume in the default volume store, if it exists. The VCH mounts the anonymous volume on the container.\nThe docker create -v example below performs the following actions:\n\nCreates a busybox container that uses an anonymous volume in the default volume store.\nMounts the volume to /volumes in the container.\n\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \ncreate -v /volumes busybox\n\nCreate a Container with a Named Volume\nTo create a container with a new named volume, you specify a volume name in the docker create -v command. When you create containers that with named volumes, the VCH checks whether the volume exists in the volume store, and if it does not, creates it. The VCH mounts the existing or new volume on the container.\nThe docker create -v example below performs the following actions:\n\nCreates a busybox container\nCreates volume named volume_1 in the default volume store.\nMounts the volume to the /volumes folder in the container.\n\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \ncreate -v volume_1:/volumes busybox\n\nMount Existing vSphere-Backed Volumes on Containers \nIf your volume store is in a vSphere datastore, mounting existing volumes on containers is subject to the following limitations:\n\nvSphere Integrated Containers currently supports mounting a volume that is backed by vSphere on only one container at a time. \nDocker does not support unmounting a volume from a container, whether that container is running or not. When you mount a volume on a container by using docker create -v,  that volume remains mounted on the container until you remove the container. When you have removed the container you can mount the volume onto a new container.\nIf you intend to create and mount a volume on one container, remove that container, and then mount the same volume on another container, use a named volume. It is possible to mount an anonymous volume on one container, remove that container, and then mount the anonymous volume on another container, but it is not recommended to do so.\n\nThe docker create -v example below performs the following operations:\n\nCreates a container named container1 from the busybox image.\nMounts the named volume volume1 to the myData folder on that container, starts the container, and attaches to it.\nAfter performing operations in volume1:/myData, stops and removes container1.\nCreates a container named container2 from the Ubuntu image.\nMounts volume1 to the myData folder on container2.\n\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \ncreate --name container1 -v volume1:/myData busybox\ndocker start container1\ndocker attach container1 \n\n[Perform container operations and detach]\n\ndocker stop container1 \ndocker rm container1\ndocker create -it --name container2 -v volume1:/myData ubuntu\ndocker start container2 \ndocker attach container2 \n\n[Perform container operations with the same volume that was \npreviously mounted to container1]\n\nSharing NFS-Backed Volumes Between Containers \nIf your volume store is in an NFS share point, sharing volumes between containers is not subject to any limitations. In vSphere Integrated Containers, the local driver is the vSphere Integrated Containers Docker personality. Consequently, the way to create NFS volumes with vSphere Integrated Containers is slightly different to how you do it with regular Docker. All that you need to do to create an NFS volume for a container is provide the name of the appropriate volume store in the docker volume create command.\ndocker volume create --opt volumestore=nfs_volumestore_name\n\nObtain Information About a Volume \nTo get information about a volume, run docker volume inspect and specify the name of the volume.\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \nvolume inspect volume_name\n\nDelete a Named Volume from a Volume Store \nTo delete a volume, run docker volume rm and specify the name of the volume to delete. \ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \nvolume rm volume_name\n\nNOTE: vSphere Integrated Containers does not support running docker rm -v to remove volumes that are associated with a container.\n"},"vic_app_dev/network_use_cases.html":{"url":"vic_app_dev/network_use_cases.html","title":"Container Networking","keywords":"","body":"Container Networking with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine\nThe following sections present examples of how to perform container networking operations when using vSphere Integrated Containers Engine as your Docker endpoint.\n\nPublish a Container Port\nAdd Containers to a New Bridge Network\nBridged Containers with an Exposed Port\nDeploy Containers on Multiple Bridge Networks\nDeploy Containers That Combine Bridge Networks with a Container Network\nDeploy a Container with a Static IP Address\n\nTo perform certain networking operations on containers, your Docker environment and your virtual container hosts (VCHs) must be configured in a specific way.\n\nFor information about the default Docker networks, see https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/.\nFor information about the networking options with which vSphere administrators can deploy VCHs, see the sections in VCH Deployment Options on Networking Options and Configure Container Networks in Install, Deploy, and Maintain the vSphere Integrated Containers Infrastructure.\nFor an overview of the networks that vSphere Integrated Containers Engine uses, see Virtual Container Host Networking in Install, Deploy, and Maintain the vSphere Integrated Containers Infrastructure.\nFor examples of how to deploy VCHs with different network configurations, see the section in Advanced Examples of Deploying a VCH on Networking Examples in Install, Deploy, and Maintain the vSphere Integrated Containers Infrastructure.\n\nNOTE: The default level of trust on VCH container networks is published. As a consequence, if the vSphere administrator did not configure --container-network-firewall on the VCH, you must specify -p 80 in docker run and docker create commands to publish port 80 on a container. Alternatively, the vSphere administrator can configure the VCH to set --container-network-firewall to a different level. \nPublish a Container Port \nConnect a container to an external mapped port on the public network of the VCH:\n$ docker run -p 8080:80 --name test1 my_container my_app\nResult:  You can access Port 80 on test1 from the public network interface on the VCH at port 8080.\nAdd Containers to a New Bridge Network \nCreate a new non-default bridge network and set up two containers on the network. Verify that the containers can locate and communicate with each other:\n$ docker network create -d bridge my-bridge-network\n$ docker network ls\n...\nNETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER\n615d565d498c        my-bridge-network   bridge\n...\n$ docker run -d --net=my-bridge-network \\\n                --name=server my_server_image server_app\n$ docker run -it --name=client --net=my-bridge-network busybox\n/ # ping server\nPING server (172.18.0.2): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 172.18.0.2: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.073 ms\n64 bytes from 172.18.0.2: seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.092 ms\n64 bytes from 172.18.0.2: seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.088 ms\nResult:  The server and client containers can ping each other by name.\nNote: Containers created on the default bridge network don't get name resolution by default in the way described above. This is consistent with docker bridge network behavior.\nBridged Containers with an Exposed Port \nConnect two containers on a bridge network and set up one of the containers to publish a port via the VCH.

You can connect to  server on port 5000 from the client container and to port 5000 on the VCH public network.\nDeploy Containers on Multiple Bridge Networks \nYou can use multiple bridge networks to isolate certain types of application network traffic. An example may be containers in a data tier communicating on one network and containers on a web tier communicating on another. In order for this to work, at least one of the containers needs to be on both networks.\nDocker syntax does not allow for the use of multiple --net arguments for docker run or docker create, so to connect a container to multiple networks, you need to use:\ndocker network connect [network-id] [container-id]\nNote: With VIC containers, networks can only be added to a container when it's in its created state. They can't be added while the container is running.\nCreate two bridge networks, one for data traffic and one for web traffic\ndocker network create --internal bridge-db\ndocker network create bridge-web\nCreate and run the data container(s)\ndocker run -d --name db --net bridge-db myrepo/mydatabase\nCreate and run the web container(s) and make sure one is on both networks.

Use ip addr to see the IP addresses.\nDeploy Containers That Combine Bridge Networks with a Container Network \nA \"container\" network is a vSphere port group that a container can be connected to directly and which allows the container to have an external identity on that network. This can be combined with one or more private bridge networks for intra-container traffic.\nNOTE: Multiple bridge networks are backed by the same port group as the default bridge, segregated via IP address management. Container networks are strongly isolated from all other networks.\nA container network is specified when the VCH is installed using vic-machine --container-network [existing-port-group] and should be visible when you run docker network ls from a docker client.\n$ docker network ls\nNETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE\nbaf6919f5721        ExternalNetwork     external            \nfc41d9a86514        bridge              bridge              \nThe three main advantages of using a container network over exposing a port on the VCH are that:\n1) The container can get its own external IP address.\n2) The container is not dependent on the VCH control plane being up for network connectivity. This allows the VCH to be powered down or upgraded with zero impact on the network connectivity of the deployed container.\n3) This avoids the use of NAT, which will benefit throughput performance\nLet's take the above example with the web and data tiers and show how it could be achieved using a container network.\nCreate one private bridge network for data traffic\ndocker network create --internal bridge-db\nCreate and run the data container(s)\ndocker run -d --name db --net bridge-db myrepo/mydatabase\nCreate and run the web container(s) and make sure one is on both networks. In this example, we only want the web-view container to have an identity on the ExternalNetwork, so the web-model container is only in the data network.\ndocker run -d --name model --net bridge-db myrepo/web-model\ndocker create -d -p 80 --name view --net bridge-db myrepo/web-view\ndocker network connect ExternalNetwork view\ndocker start view\nResult:  \n\nAll the containers can communicate with each other.\ndb and web-model cannot communicate externally\nweb-view has its own external IP address and its service is available on port 80 of that IP address\n\nNote: Given that a container network manifests as a vNIC on the container VM, it has its own distinct network interface in the container.\nDeploy a Container with a Static IP Address \nDeploy a container that has a static IP address on the container network. For you to be able to deploy containers with static IP addresses, the vSphere administrator must have specified the --container-network-ip-range option when they deployed the VCH. The IP address that you specify in docker network connect --ip must be within the specified range. If you do not specify --ip, the VCH assigns an IP address from the range that the vSphere administrator specified in --container-network-ip-range.\n$ docker network connect --ip ip_address container-net container1\n\nResult:  The container container1 runs with the specified IP address on the container-net network.\n"},"vic_app_dev/creating_containerized_app_with_vic.html":{"url":"vic_app_dev/creating_containerized_app_with_vic.html","title":"Creating a Containerized App","keywords":"","body":"Creating Containerized Applications with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine\nThe topics in this section provides guidelines for container developers who want to use vSphere Integrated Containers Engine to develop and deploy a containerized application.\nvSphere Integrated Containers is designed to help you get the best out of your vSphere infrastucture by adding a container consumption model to it. That means that you can consume vSphere networks, storage and compute in a way that's familiar, autonomous, scriptable,  opinionated and portable. There are significant benefits to this approach and also limits to what you can do.\nThis section will help you to understand the considerations, benefits and limits to putting containers into production with VIC engine. It includes plenty of examples of common deployment scenarios, including using Docker Compose.\n\nHow to get the best out of vSphere Integrated Containers when putting containerized applications into production\nExample of deploying a single container VM into production with vSphere Integrated Containers engine\n\nExample of deploying multiple container VMs into production using Docker Compose\n\n\n\n\n"},"vic_app_dev/putting_apps_into_production.html":{"url":"vic_app_dev/putting_apps_into_production.html","title":"Putting Apps into Production","keywords":"","body":"Putting Applications into Production with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine\nvSphere Integrated Containers engine is designed to be a docker API compatible production endpoint for containerized workloads. As such, the design focus is on provisioning containerized applications with optimal isolation, security, data persistence, throughput performance and to take advantage of vSphere capabilities.\nvSphere Integrated Containers engine is designed to make existing features of vSphere easy to consume and exploit by providing compatibilty with the Docker image format and Docker client. Inevitably that means that there are some differences between a regular Docker host and a Virtual Container Host (VCH), and between a Linux container and a container VM. Some of those differences are intentional design constraints, such as there being no such thing as a \"privileged\" container in VIC. Some are because of a lack of functional completeness, while others are outside of the existing scope of the product, such as native support for docker build.\nThere are other sections that discuss these topics in more depth, but this section is intented to help you to understand how to maximize business value by understanding how the capabilities of the product map to production requirements.\nBuilding Images for production\nWhile official images on sites like Docker Hub are useful for showing how an application might be containerized, these images are rarely suitable to put into production as is. Exploring how to customize images is outside of the scope of this document, but important considerations include:\n\nAnonymous volumes\n\nYou can specify a volume in a container image using the VOLUME keyword. However, this does not allow you to specify any characteristics about the volumes. A VCH can have mutliple volume stores and a volume is a disk, so being able to specify an appropriate volume store and the size of the disk is an important consideration.\nNote also that a volume in vSphere Integrated Containers will have a /lost+found folder in it due to the ext4 filesystem and if your application needs an empty folder, you should specify a sub directory in the volume. Eg.\ndocker run -v mydisk:/mountpoint -e DATA_DIR=/mountpoint/data myimage\n\nExposing network ports\n\nYou can expose network ports in a Dockerfile using EXPOSE and leave it up to the container engine to define port mappings using docker run -P. There are a few considerations with this. \nIf you want to expose your container to other containers on a bridge network, you don't need to use EXPOSE. Your container will be resolvable by name. \nIf you want your container to be externally accessible, VIC engine gives you the option to use an external container network rather than port mapping. This is more robust and more performant because it doesn't depend on the container engine being available for a network connection and it doesn't rely on NAT networking. Your container gets its own IP address on that container network. Exposing your container on a container network cannot be specified in a Dockerfile.\nIf you want to use a port mapping on the VCH endpoint VM, it's rarely the case that you want the container engine to pick a random port and again, that's not something that can be specified in the Dockerfile. Better to use docker run -p : at deployment.\n\nEnvironment variables\n\nEnvironment variables are a very useful way of setting both static and dynamic configuration. Use of Environment variables in a Dockerfile should be considered static configuration as they will be the same on every deployment. Setting them on the command-line allows for dynamic configuration and over-riding of static settings.\nEphemeral and Persistent State\nThe question of where a container stores its state is an important one. A container has an ephemeral filesystem and multiple optional persistent volume mounts. Any writes to any part of the filesystem that is not a mounted volume is stored only until the container is deleted. \nWhen a regular Linux container is deployed into a VM, there are typically two types of filesystem in the guest OS. An overlay filesystem manages the image data and stores ephemeral state. A volume will typically be another part of the guest filesystem mounted into the container. As such it is also possible for Linux containers to have shared read/write access to the same filesystem on the container host. This is useful in development, but potentially problematic in production as it forces containers to be tied to each other and to a specific container host. That may well be by design in the case where multiple containers form a single service and a single unit of scale. What's important however is to consider the scope, persistence and isolation of data when deploying containerized applications.\nTake a database container as an example. Its data almost certainly needs to be backed up, live beyond the lifecycle of the container and not be mixed up with any other kind of data. The problem of peristing such state onto a container host filesystem is that it's mixed in with other state and cannot easily be backed up, unless the host itself has a disk mounted specifically for that purpose. There are volume drivers that can be used with Docker engine for this purpose. Eg. VMware Docker Volume Service\nWhen you deploy a container to a VCH, ephemeral state is written to a delta disk (an ephemeral layer on top of the image layers) and volumes are independently mounted disks which can only be mounted to one container at a time. When creating a volume, you can specify the size of the disk and the volume store it gets deployed to. If you select a volume store backed by a shared datastore, that volume will be available to any container anywhere in the vSphere cluster. This is particularly useful when it comes to the live migration of stateful containers. The vSphere administrator will be responsible for backup policy associated with the datastore.\nAs such, VIC makes it easy to store persistent data to disks that are independent of VMs, can be written to shared datastores and can participate in the same backup and security policies as regular VMs. \nNote that an anonymous volume declared in a Dockerfile will manifest as a mounted disk of a default size (1GB) to a default datastore. This is almost always going to be the wrong option in production for the reasons stated above.\nYou can use NFS to mount shared read-write volumes to container VMs.\nContainer Isolation\nA container deployed to a VCH is strongly isolated by design. Strongly isolated means:\n\nThe container gets its own Linux kernel which is not used for any other purpose\nThe container gets its own filesystem and buffer cache which is not used for any other purpose\nThe container cannot get access to the container control plane or get information about any other containers\nPrivilege escalation or container breakouts in the conventional sense are not possible\nThe container operates independent of its control plane (assuming port mapping is not being used)\nThe container can take advantage of vSphere High Availability and vMotion\n\nNetwork isolation is handled in a similar way to Docker, except that containers can be connected directly to vSphere port groups (see container networks). Storage isolation is discussed above.\nThis kind of strong isolation is best suited to a container workload that is a long-running service. If the service fails, it should have no impact on any other services. Examples of a long-running service are a database, web server, key-value store etc.\nContainers are very flexible abstractions however and not every container is designed to be a single service. In fact, some containers are designed to be combined to form a single service and a single unit of scale. This notion is sometimes described as a Pod. In such a circumstance, it may be beneficial to run these as Linux containers in a single VM. VIC engine is providing built-in support for this model of provisioning Linux container hosts as VIC containers in 1.2.\nWhat's important is to consider the policy needs of your application in terms of isolation. Strong isolation is a very important consideration in deploying robust applications into production and VIC makes it easy to turn that policy into plumbing.\n"},"vic_app_dev/deploy_single_containervm.html":{"url":"vic_app_dev/deploy_single_containervm.html","title":"Deploy a Single Container VM","keywords":"","body":"Building and Deploying Single Containers to a Virtual Container Host\nThis section assumes that you already have a Virtual Container Host installed and that you are accessing it using TLS authentication.\nFor simplicity, pre-built Docker images are demonstrated to illustrate principles of operation. It is assumed that in reality you will have your own Docker images built.\nThis section will illustrate a number of useful capabilities such as pre-poluating data volumes, creating custom images and running daemon processes.\nDeploying a Database - Postgres 9.6\nAll databases will have common requirements. A database should almost always be strongly isolated and long-running, so is a perfect candidate for a container VM. Steps to consider include:\n\nChoose a volume store for your database state\nChoose a size for your persistent volume\nChoose a network for your container. Does it need to be exposed externally or privately to other containers?\nHow many CPUs and how much memory do you want for your database?\n\nNote that the Dockerfile uses VOLUME and EXPOSE to illustrate that it needs to store persistent state and that you should be able to reach it on a particular port. As discussed here, anonymous volumes and random port mappings are fine for a sandbox, but not for production. \nIn this example, we create a 10GB volume disk on a backed up shared datastore. We'll use a private network to access the database, assuming that another container will need to access it privately. We use environment variables to set the data directory and password. We give the container a name so that it can be resolved using that name on the private network. Finally, we choose 2 vCPUs and 4GB of RAM.\ndocker network create datanet\ndocker volume create --opt Capacity=10G --opt VolumeStore=shared-backedup pgdata\ndocker run --name db -d -v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data -e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/data -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=y7u8i9o0p --cpus 2 -m 4g --net datanet postgres:9.6\nOnce the container has started, you can use docker ps to make sure it's running. You can use docker logs db to see the logs. You can use docker exec -it db /bin/bash (only available in VIC 1.2+) to get a shell into the container.\nNow let's check that it's visible on the private network and it's running correctly. We can do this using a VIC container running on the same private network:\ndocker run --rm -it --net datanet postgres:9.6 /bin/bash\n   $ ping db\n     PING db (172.18.0.2): 56 data bytes\n     64 bytes from 172.18.0.2: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.856 ms\n     ...\n   $ pg_isready -h db\n     db:5432 - accepting connections\nIf we stop and delete the container, the data volume will persist. It will even persist beyond the lifespan of the VCH unless vic-machine delete --force is used.\nDeploying an Application Server - Tomcat 9 with JRE 8\nLooking at the Dockerfile here, there are no anonymous volumes specified. However, we need to consider how to get our application deployed and we may want to set some JVM configuration.\nLet's start by deploying Tomcat on an external container network to make sure it works\ndocker run --name web -d -p 8080 -e JAVA_OPTS=\"-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom\" --net ExternalNetwork tomcat:9\ndocker logs web\ndocker inspect web | grep IPAddress\ncurl :8080\nHopefully an index.html showing Tomcat server running is shown. Of course you can also test this using a browser. Note that you can pass JRE options in as an environment variable. In this case, we're passing in an option to get Tomcat to start faster by using a non-blocking entropy source (see https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/HowTo/FasterStartUp).\nNext step is to consider how to get a webapp onto the application server. There are static and dynamic approaches to this problem. \nPre-populate a Volume\nYou can use a container to pre-populate a volume with a web application that you then bind when you run the application server. This is a late-binding dynamic approach that has the advantage that the container image remains general-purpose. The downside is that it requires an extra step to populate the volume.\ndocker volume create webapp\ndocker run --rm -v webapp:/data -w /data tomcat:9 curl -O https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/appdev/sample/sample.war\ndocker run --name web -d -p 8080 -e JAVA_OPTS=\"-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom\" -v webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps --net ExternalNetwork tomcat:9\ncurl :8080/sample\nThe volume is a disk of default size, in this case 1GB. The command to populate the volume mounts it at /data and then tells the container to use /data as the working directory. It then uses the fact that the Tomcat container has curl installed to download a sample web app as a WAR file to the volume. When the volume is mounted to /usr/local/tomcat/webapps, it replaces any existing webapps such as the welcome page and Tomcat runs just the sample app.\nIf you don't want the volume to completely replace the existing /webapps directory, you can modify the above example to extract the WAR file to the volume and then mount the volume as a subdirectory of webapps.\ndocker volume create webapp\ndocker run --rm -v webapp:/data -w /data tomcat:9 /bin/bash -c \"curl -O https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/appdev/sample/sample.war; unzip sample.war; rm sample.war\"\ndocker run --name web -d -p 8080 -e JAVA_OPTS=\"-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom\" -v webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/sample --net ExternalNetwork tomcat:9\ncurl :8080/sample\nNote that running multiple commands on a container can be done using /bin/bash -c. There's a discussion below as to why this isn't necessarily ideal for a running service, but for chaining simple commands together, it works fine. Now, not only is your sample app available, but any other app baked into the image in /usr/local/tomcat/webapps is also available.\nBuild a custom image\nBuilding a custom image allows you to copy the sample webapp into the container image filesystem and make some other improvements and upgrades while you're there. This then creates a single purpose container that runs the webapp(s) baked into it.\nNote that VIC engine does not have a native docker build capability. Containers should be built using docker engine and VIC engine relies on the portability of the Docker image format to run them. In order to do this, the built image needs to be pushed to a registry that the VCH can access. This is one reason why such a registry is built into the vSphere Integrated Containers product.\nDockerfile:\nFROM tomcat:9\n\nENV JAVA_OPTS \"-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom\"\nCOPY sample.war /usr/local/bin/webapps\nIn a VM running standard docker engine:\ndocker build -t // .\ndocker login \ndocker push //\nFrom a docker client attached to a VCH\ndocker run --name web -d -p 8080 --net ExternalNetwork //\nNote that the use of the /dev/urandom above is not considered particularly secure as it doesn't address the underlying problem of lack of entropy. One of the advantages of building a new image is that it can be customized, so for example, you can install the haveged package to solve your entropy problem.\nHowever, one of the interesting challenges of containers is that they're designed to only run one process and they don't have a conventional init system. So installing haveged in a Dockerfile doesn't mean that it will actually run when deployed.\nLet's examime some solutions to this problem\nRunning Daemon Processes in a VIC container\nAlthough a VIC container is a VM, it is a very opinionated VM in that it has the same constraints as a container. It doesn't have a conventional init system and its lifecycle is coupled to a single main process. There are a few ways of running daemon processes in a container - many of which are far from ideal.\nFor example, simply chaining commands in a Dockerfile CMD instruction techically works, but it compromises the signal handling and exit codes of the container. As a result, docker stop will almost certainly not work as intended. What would that look like in our Tomcat example?\nFROM tomcat:9\n\nRUN apt-get update;apt-get install -y haveged\nCOPY sample.war /usr/local/bin/webapps\nCMD /usr/sbin/haveged && catalina.sh run\nSo this is not a recommended approach. Try running docker stop and it will timeout and eventually kill the container. This is not a problem exclusive to VIC engine, this is a general problem with container images.\nA much simpler approach is to run haveged using docker exec once the container is started:\ndocker run --name web -d -p 8080 -v webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps --net ExternalNetwork /\ndocker exec -d web /usr/sbin/haveged\nDocker exec with the -d option runs a process as a daemon in the container. While this is arguably the neatest solution to the problem, it does require a subsequent call to the container after it's started. While it's relatively simple to script this, it doesn't work well in a scenario such as a Compose file.\nSo a third approach is to create a script that the container starts when it initializes that uses a trap handler to manage signals.\nrc.local\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncleanup() \n{\n   kill $(pidof /docker-java-home/jre/bin/java)\n}\n\ntrap cleanup EXIT\n\n/usr/sbin/haveget\ncatalina.sh run\nDockerfile\nFROM tomcat:9\n\nRUN apt-get update;apt-get install -y haveged\nCOPY sample.war /usr/local/bin/webapps\nCMD [ \"/etc/rc.local\" ]\nCOPY rc.local /etc/\nDeploying a Development Environment\nYou can use VIC to run a development environment that can be used either interactively or as a means of running builds or test suites.\nLet's look at some simple examples. Regardless of the approach, we'll need code mounted into the development environment. The simplest way to achieve this is using a volume. Let's download the VIC repository onto a volume.\ndocker volume create vic-build\ndocker run --rm -v vic-build:/build -w /build golang:1.8 git clone https://github.com/vmware/vic.git\nInteractive\nThe source code tree lives on the persistent volume and can be re-used across invocations of the development environment. The command below will take you straight into a golang development environment shell.\ndocker run --rm -it -v vic-build:/go/src/github.com/vmware/ -w /go/src/github.com/vmware/vic golang:1.8\nRunning a Build\nLet's build VIC using the volume created above. That's a simple matter of appropriately sizing the container VM and running make.\ndocker run --rm -m 4g -v vic-build:/go/src/github.com/vmware/ -w /go/src/github.com/vmware/vic golang:1.8 make all\nThe output of the build also lives on the volume. You need to ensure that the volume is big enough. VIC engine 1.2 will support NFS volume mounts which could be a great alternative for the build source and output.\n"},"vic_app_dev/deploy_multiple_docker_compose.html":{"url":"vic_app_dev/deploy_multiple_docker_compose.html","title":"Deploy Container VMs with Compose","keywords":"","body":"Building and Deploying Multi-Container Applications to a Virtual Container Host\nHaving examined some of the considerations around deploying single containers to a Virtual Container Host (VCH), this section examples how to deploy applications that are comprised of multiple containers.\nThere are two approaches you can take to this. The most instictive approach would be to create scripts that manage the lifecycle of volumes, networks and containers.\nThe second approach is to use a manifest-based orchestrator such as Docker Compose. VIC 1.1 has some basic support for Docker Compose, but it is not functionally complete. Docker Compose is a proprietary orchestrator that drives the Docker API and ties other pieces of the Docker ecosystem together including Build and Swarm. Given that VIC engine doesn't currently support either Build or Swarm, Compose compatibility is necessarily limited. However, Compose can still be a useful tool, provided those limitations are understood.\nScripting Multi-Container Applications\nLet's start by looking at how you would script Wordpress running in one container and a MySQL database in another. We can then use some of the considerations and topics discussed and apply that to the Compose example later.\nAs with the single container examples, we need to consider:\n\nWhat persistent state needs to be stored and where should it go?\nHow should the containers communicate with each other?\nDoes each container need to be strongly isolated?\nHow should each container be sized?\n\nFor this example, we're going to create two named volumes on different vSphere datastores. Database state is going to a persistent volume on a shared datastore that's backed up and encrypted. The Wordpress HTML state is going to a shared datastore that's less expensive.\nWe're going to create a private network for the database and expose the Wordpress container on a second network that exposes a port on the VCH endpoint.\nThe Wordpress application server and the database container don't necessarily have to be separate failure domains, but one of the advantages of VIC engine is that it makes it easy to deploy them that more secure way, so that's the approach we're taking here. \nThe question of sizing is a simple matter of setting virtual CPUs and memory on each container.\nIf we were to create a shell script to stand this up, it might look like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nDB_PASSWORD=wordpress\nDB_USER=wordpress\n\nWEB_CTR_NAME=web\nDB_CTR_NAME=db\n\n# pull the images first\ndocker pull wordpress\ndocker pull mysql:5.7\n\n# create a persistent volume for the database\ndocker volume create --opt Capacity=4G --opt VolumeStore=backed-up-encrypted db-data\ndocker volume create --opt Capacity=2G --opt VolumeStore=default html-data\n\n# create a private network for the web container to talk to the database. This will fail if the network already exists.\ndocker network create --internal db-net\ndocker network create web-net\n\n# start the database container - specify a subdirectory on the volume as the data dir\ndocker run -d --name $DB_CTR_NAME --net db-net -v db-data:/var/lib/mysql --cpus 1 -m 2g -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=somewordpress -e MYSQL_DATABASE=$DB_PASSWORD -e MYSQL_USER=$DB_USER -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=wordpress mysql:5.7 --datadir=/var/lib/mysql/data\n\n# start the web container - note it resolves the database container by name over db-net\ndocker create --name $WEB_CTR_NAME --net web-net -p 8080:80 -v html-data:/var/www/html --cpus 2 -m 4g -e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=$DB_CTR_NAME:3306 -e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=$DB_USER -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD wordpress\n\ndocker network connect db-net $WEB_CTR_NAME\n\ndocker start $WEB_CTR_NAME\n\n# check that the containers are up and look at the IP address and port of the web container\ndocker ps | grep \"$WEB_CTR_NAME\\|$DB_CTR_NAME\"\nA second script to shut down the two containers and clean up everything might look like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndocker stop web db\ndocker rm web db\n\n# uncomment to delete volume state\n# docker volume rm db-data html-data\n\n# uncomment to delete networks\n# docker network rm db-net web-net\nBlocking on Container Readiness\nIn the above example, the Wordpress container waits for about 10 seconds for the database to come up and be ready. What if it needs to wait longer than that? This is one of the ways docker exec (coming in VIC 1.2) can be useful. For example:\n# wait until the database is up - VIC 1.2+\nwhile true; do\n   docker exec -it db mysqladmin --user=$DB_USER --password=$DB_PASSWORD version > /dev/null 2>&1\n   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n      break\n   fi\n   sleep 5\ndone\nIt's worth noting that the MySQL docker hub page states:\nIf there is no database initialized when the container starts, then a default database will be created. \nWhile this is the expected behavior, this means that it will not accept incoming connections until such initialization completes. \nThis may cause issues when using automation tools, such as docker-compose, which start several containers simultaneously.\nThe user of docker exec is the quickest and simplest mechanism you can use to execute a binary in a running container and test its return code. A cleaner solution might be to add your own custom script to the database image that blocks until the database is ready and then call that using docker exec. This eliminates the need to call docker exec in a sleep loop. \nIf you want to modify the Wordpress image to add a database connection test, you would have to create a script that the container will evoke that runs the test before running the main process and deals correctly with signal handling. See here for a discussion on ways to achieve this.\nRunning Multi-Container Applications Using Docker Compose\nBefore we get into the topic of building applications for Docker Compose, let's look at an example of how we would run the equivalent of the above script using Docker Compose and vSphere Integrated Containers engine.\nDocker Compose serializes a manifest in a YML file which the docker-compose binary turns into docker commands. The equivalent of the above script as a Compose file would be the following:\nversion: '2'\n\nservices:\n   db:\n     image: mysql:5.7\n     command: --datadir=/var/lib/mysql/data\n     volumes:\n       - db-data:/var/lib/mysql\n     networks:\n       - db-net\n     environment:\n       MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: somewordpress\n       MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress\n       MYSQL_USER: wordpress\n       MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress\n\n   wordpress:\n     depends_on:\n       - db\n     image: wordpress:latest\n     ports:\n       - \"8080:80\"\n     volumes:\n       - html-data:/var/www/html\n     networks:\n       - web-net\n       - db-net\n     environment:\n       WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306\n       WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress\n       WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress\n\nvolumes:\n    db-data:\n       driver: \"vsphere\"\n       driver_opts:\n          Capacity: \"4G\"\n          VolumeStore: \"backed-up-encrypted\"\n    html-data:\n       driver: \"vsphere\"\n       driver_opts:\n          Capacity: \"2G\"\n          VolumeStore: \"default\"\n\nnetworks:\n    web-net:\n    db-net:\n       internal: true\nNote that there is no way to run exec commands explicitly in a compose file, so any waits for dependent services to come up need to be built into the containers themselves.\nHow to Manage the Application Lifecycle with docker-compose and VIC engine\nAssuming you've downloaded an appropriate version of the docker-compose binary, you need to point docker-compose at a VCH endpoint. This is done either by setting DOCKER_HOST=: or using docker-compose -H :. \nDependencies between the compose file and vic-machine configuration\nGiven that the VCH lifecycle is handled by a vSphere administrator, there may be some named resources in the VCH that need to be referenced in the Compose file. For example, in the Compose file above are the names of two volume stores. There may other assumptions, such as the name of a container network for example. As a user, it's important to know how to get this information from your VCH so that you can configure your Compose file appropriately.\nTo view a list of networks that have been pre-configured by the vSphere admin, use docker network ls and look for ones marked external. \nTo view a list of volume stores that have been pre-configured by the vSphere admin, use docker info | grep VolumeStores.\nTLS Authentication\nAssuming you're using TLS authentication to the Docker endpoint, that is either done using environment variables or command-line options. \nWith environment variables, it's assumed that you've already set DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1 and DOCKER_CERT_PATH=. This is required in order to use the docker client. For docker-compose you have to additionally set COMPOSE_TLS_VERSION=TLSv1_2. You can then run docker-compose up -d to start the application (assuming you've also set DOCKER_HOST to point to the VCH endpoint).\nUsing command-line arguments with docker client is a little more clumsy as each key has to be specified independently and the same is true of docker-compose. Regardless, the only way to specify the TLS version is through the environment variable above COMPOSE_TLS_VERSION=TLSv1_2. You can then run docker-compose -H :2376 --tlsverify --tlscacert=\"/ca.pem\" --tlscert=\"/cert.pem\" --tlskey=\"/key.pem\" compose up -d\nLifecycle Commands\nThe docker-compose binary is well documented and it is outside of the scope of this document to go into detail on that. However, given the example given above, the following lifecycle commands work:\ndocker-compose pull                    # pull the required images\ndocker-compose up -d                   # start the application in the background\ndocker-compose logs                    # see the logs of the containers started\ndocker-compose images                  # list the images in use\ndocker-compose stop                    # cleanly stop the running containers, leave container state\ndocker-compose kill                    # force kill of the container processes\ndocker-compose start                   # restart the application\ndocker-compose down                    # stop the application and remove the resources, leaving persistent volumes and images\ndocker-compose down --volumes --rmi    # stop the application and remove all resources including volumes and images\nBuilding Multi-Container Applications Using Docker Compose\nGiven that VIC engine does not have a native build capability, it does not interpret the build keyword in a compose file and docker-compose build will not work when DOCKER_HOST points to a VIC endpoint. VIC engine relies upon the portability of the docker image format and it is expected that a regular docker engine will be used in a CI pipeline to build container images for test and deployment.\nThere are two ways to work around this. You can create separate Compose files for build and run, or you can use the same Compose file but just make sure to add a couple of arguments. We will explore both options here using another example of a Compose file that includes build instructions. In this case, the sample voting application found here\nLet's start by cloning the repository: git clone git@github.com:dockersamples/example-voting-app.git and we'll start by looking at docker-compose-simple.yml. \nUsing separate Compose files\nYou can strip a Compose file down to an absolute minimum if you want to use it just for building and pushing images. If you want to run the application on a VIC endpoint, you'll need to also push the built images to a docker registry visible to your VCH, so that they can be deployed. In order to do that, we need to add image directives to the Compose file.\n$ more docker-compose-simple-build.yml \nversion: \"2\"\n\nservices:\n  vote:\n    build: ./vote\n    image: //vote:0.1\n\n  worker:\n    build: ./worker\n    image: //worker:0.1\n\n  result:\n    build: ./result\n    image: //result:0.1\n\n$ sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-simple-build.yml build \n$ sudo docker login \n$ sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-simple-build.yml push\nNow that the application is built and pushed, you need to create a second Compose file for deployment that reflects the deployment considerations discussed earlier in terms of isolation, peristent volume state, networking etc. The Compose file provided in the repo is simply an example and you would typically expect to have to change it to suit your needs. Let's do that, but keep it as simple as possible to begin with. \nModifications from the original file are highlighted as comments\nversion: \"2\"      # VIC engine supports Compose file version 2\n\nservices:\n  vote:\n    image: //vote:0.1    # Fully-qualified image name\n    command: python app.py\n    ports:                          # Local ./vote volume mount removed - use the app.py built-in\n      - \"5000:80\"\n\n  redis:\n    image: redis:alpine\n    ports: [\"6379\"]\n\n  worker:\n    image: //worker:0.1    # Fully-qualified image name\n\n  db:\n    image: postgres:9.4\n    environment:\n      PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data/data     # Added as a workaround to /lost+found in volume root\n\n  result:\n    image: //result:0.1    # Fully-qualified image name\n    command: nodemon --debug server.js\n    ports:                          # Local ./results volume mount removed - use the server.js built-in\n      - \"5001:80\"\n      - \"5858:5858\"\nLet's review the changes that were made to this Compose file. \n\nFully qualified image name\n\nIn most real-world scenarios, container images will be pushed to a registry before they're deployed into production. That means that the registry and a project will be part of the image name. The only way it will run with just the container name is if it has been built locally.\n\nRemoved local volume mappings\n\nLocal volume mounts are useful for development and testing as they allow source trees and data to be easily mapped into a container. In production however, making a container host stateful for the purpose of seeding the container with configuration or application data is only feasible if the container is guaranteed to be deployed to the stateful host. In general, best practice is to keep a container host as stateless as possible. \nVIC engine cannot map volumes from a local filesystem into a container because VIC engine containers are strongly isolated and don't share a common filesystem. Despite this, it is still possible in VIC to add state to a container by pre-populating a volume with data and mounting it (TBD: link to \"Pre-populate a Volume\").\n\nWorkaround to /lost+found folder\n\nIn VIC a Volume is an ext4 formatted disk. As such, it has /lost+found in the root. Some containers will not write data into this directory due to the presence of this folder, so in this case of postgres above, it is configured to create and write to a subdirectory of the mount point.\nCombining into a single Compose file\nIf separate Compose files feels clunky, it's quite possible to build, push and run from the same Compose file. All we need to do is to merge them together and then make sure we tell docker-compose what we want. Here's an example of a merged file:\nversion: \"2\"\n\nservices:\n  vote:\n    build: ./vote\n    image: //vote:0.1\n    command: python app.py\n    ports:\n      - \"5000:80\"\n\n  redis:\n    image: redis:alpine\n    ports: [\"6379\"]\n\n  worker:\n    build: ./worker\n    image: //worker:0.1\n\n  db:\n    image: postgres:9.4\n    environment:\n      PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data/data\n\n  result:\n    build: ./result\n    image: //result:0.1\n    command: nodemon --debug server.js\n    ports:\n      - \"5001:80\"\n      - \"5858:5858\"\nBuild and push work in just the same way as the previous example. The rest of the directives are ignored. \nIn order to deploy this to a VIC endpoint however, you need to first explicitly pull the images. Otherwise docker-compose will try to build them, even if you attempt to run with --no-build. Then you run the Compose file with --no-build to tell docker-compose to ignore the build directives. \n$ sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-simple-vic.yml build\n$ sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-simple-vic.yml push\n$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-simple-vic.yml pull\n$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-simple-vic.yml up --no-build -d\nIn the example above, the use of sudo creates a child shell that runs a local docker engine and bypasses the environment variables configured to make docker-compose talk to a VIC endpoint. In this way, it's possible to do a build, push, pull and run from the same shell using the same client.\nA Summary on Compatibility\nGiven that VIC is designed to be an enterprise runtime and has unique isolation characteristics applied to the containers it deploys, a Docker Compose script downloaded from the web may not work without modification. \nThis is partly a question of functional completeness of VIC engine docker API support and partly a question of its inherent design. There are some highly detailed technical sections in the documentation highlighting all of the capabilities VIC engine currently supports, but here is a high-level summary of topics discussed in more detail above:\n\nVIC engine supports version 2 of the Compose File format.\nVIC engine has no native build support.\nVIC volumes are disks and when mounted, have a /lost+found folder created by ext4. For some containers - databases in particular - you will need to configure them to use a subdirectory of the volume. See MySQL example above.\nVIC containers take time to boot and thus may exhibit timing related issues. Eg. You may need to set COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT to a higher value than the default.\nVIC containers have no notion of local read-write shared storage.\n\nOne of the main reasons this section takes you through all the considerations of putting a multi-container application into production with the Docker client prior to introducing Docker Compose is to help you understand how to configure Compose to work with the capabilities of VIC. Trying to work the opposite way around, by trying to configure VIC to work with capabilities of Compose may be trickier for the reasons stated.\n"},"vic_app_dev/ts_volume_store_error.html":{"url":"vic_app_dev/ts_volume_store_error.html","title":"Default Volume Store Error","keywords":"","body":"Default Volume Store Error\nWhen you create or run a container, the Docker operation fails with an error about a missing volume store.  \nProblem\nRunning the container fails with error:\ndocker: Error response from daemon: No volume store named (default) exists.\nCause\nBy default, vic-machine create does not create a volume store when the vSphere administrator deploys a VCH.
