With vSphere Integrated Containers Engine, containers are provisioned as virtual machines, offering the same security and functionality of virtual machines in VMware ESXi™ hosts or vCenter Server® instances.\nThis overview is intended for vSphere administrators who intend to use vSphere Integrated Containers to manage container workloads in their vSphere environment. \n\nIntroduction to Containers, Images and Volumes\nRuntime\nPackaging \n\n\nWhat is vSphere Integrated Containers?\nWhat Does vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Do?\nWhat Is vSphere Integrated Containers Engine For?\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine Concepts\nContainer VMs \nVirtual Container Hosts \nThe VCH Endpoint VM \nThe vic-machine Utility \n\n\n\nIntroduction to Containers, Images and Volumes \nThe word \"container\" is an overloaded one these days. When understanding containers and how they relate to vSphere Integrated Containers, it is helpful to distinguish the runtime aspect from the packaging aspect.\nRuntime \nAt its most basic, a container is simply a sandbox in which a process can run. The sandbox isolates the process from other processes that are running on the same system. A container has a lifecycle which is typically tied to the lifecycle of the process that it is designed to run. If you start a container, it starts its main process and when that process ends, the container stops. The container might have access to some storage. It typically has an identity on a network.\nConceptually, a container represents many of the same capabilities as a VM. The main difference between the two is the abstraction layer:\n\nA software container is a sandbox within a guest OS and it is up to the guest to provide the container with its dependencies and to enforce isolation. Multiple containers share the guest kernel, networking, and storage. A container does not boot. It is simply a slice of an already-running OS. The OS running the container is called its host.\n\nIn contrast, a VM is a sandbox within a hypervisor. It is the hypervisor that provides a VM with its dependencies, such as virtual disks and NICs. A VM has to boot an OS and its lifecycle is typically tied to that of the OS rather than to that of any one process. By design, a VM is strongly isolated from other VMs and its host.\n\n\nOne of the most interesting facets of containers is how they deal with state. Any data that a container writes is non-persistent by default and is lost when that container is deleted. State, however, can persist beyond the lifespan of a container by attaching a volume to it or by sending it over a network. Binary dependencies that the container needs, such as OS libraries or application binaries, are encapsulated in images . Images are immutable.\nPackaging \nOne of the most significant benefits of containers is that they allow you to package up the entire environment that an application needs and run it anywhere. You can go to Docker Hub, select from hundreds of thousands of applications and run that application anywhere that you have installed Docker on a compatible OS. The packaging encapsulates the binary dependencies, environment variables, volumes, and even the network configuration. \nThe format of this packaging is called an image. An image is a template from which many containers can instantiate. The Docker image format allows for images to be composed in a parent-child relationship, just like a disk snapshot. This image hierarchy allows containers to share common dependencies. For example, you might have a Debian 8 image that has a child image with Java installed. That Java image might have a child with Tomcat installed. The Debian 8 image might have other children, such as PHP, Python, and so on. \nThe immutability of the image format means that you never modify an image, you always create a new one. The layered nature of the image format means that you can cache commonly-used layers so that you only need to download or upload the layers that you do not already have. It also means that if you want to patch a particular image, you create a new image and then rebuild all of its children. \nThe main advantage of the image format is its portability. As long as you have a destination that is running a container engine, for example Docker, you can download and run an image on it. This portability is facilitated by a registry. A registry is a service that indexes and stores images. You can run your own private image registry that forms part of a development pipeline. You can push images to the registry from development, pull them into a test environment for verification, and then pull them into a production environment.\nWhat is vSphere Integrated Containers? \nvSphere Integrated Containers comprises the following major components:\n\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine: A container engine that is designed to integrate of all the packaging and runtime benefits of containers with the enterprise capabilities of your vSphere environment. \nvSphere Integrated Containers Registry: A Docker image registry with additional capabilities such as role-based access control (RBAC), replication, and so on.\n\nBoth components currently support the Docker image format. vSphere Integrated Containers is entirely Open Source and free to use. Support for vSphere Integrated Containers is included in the vSphere Enterprise Plus license.\nvSphere Integrated Containers is designed to solve many of the challenges associated with putting containerized applications into production. It directly uses the clustering, dynamic scheduling, and virtualized infrastructure in vSphere and bypasses the need to maintain discrete Linux VMs as container hosts.\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine allows you, the vSphere administrator, to provide a container management endpoint to a user as a service. At the same time, you remain in complete control over the infrastructure that the container management endpoint service depends on. The main differences between vSphere Integrated Containers Engine and a classic container environment are the following:\n\nvSphere, not Linux, is the container host:\nContainers are deployed as VMs, not in VMs.\nEvery container is fully isolated from the host and from the other containers.\nvSphere provides per-tenant dynamic resource limits within a vCenter Server cluster\n\n\nvSphere, not Linux, is the infrastructure:\nYou can select vSphere networks that appear in the Docker client as container networks.\nImages, volumes, and container state are provisioned directly to VMFS.\n\n\nvSphere is the control plane:\nUse the Docker client to directly control selected elements of vSphere infrastructure.\nA container endpoint Service-as-a-Service presents as a service abstraction, not as IaaS.\n\n\n\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine is designed to be the fastest and easiest way to provision any Linux-based workload to vSphere, if that workload can be serialized as a Docker image.\nWhat Does vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Do? \nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine gives you, the vSphere administrator, the tools to easily make your vSphere infrastructure accessible to users so that they can provision container workloads into production.\nScenario 1: A Classic Container Environment\nIn a classic container environment: \n\nA user raises a ticket and says, \"I need Docker\". \nYou provision a large Linux VM and send them the IP address.\nThe user installs Docker, patches the OS, configures in-guest network and storage virtualization, secures the guest, isolates the containers, packages the containers efficiently, and manages upgrades and downtime. \n\nIn this scenario, what you have provided is similar to a nested hypervisor that they have to manage and which is opaque to you.If you scale that up to one large Linux VM per tenant, you end up creating a large distributed silo for containers.\nScenario 2: vSphere Integrated Containers Engine\nWith vSphere Integrated Containers Engine: \n\nA user raises a ticket and says, \"I need Docker\". \nYou identify datastores, networking, and compute on your cluster that the user can use for their Docker environment. \nYou use a utility called vic-machine to install a small appliance. The appliance represents an authorization to use the infrastructure that you have identified, into which the user can self-provision container workloads.\nThe appliance runs a secure remote Docker API, that is the only access that the user has to the vSphere infrastructure.\nInstead of sending your user a Linux VM, you send them the IP address of the appliance, the port of the remote Docker API, and a certificate for secure access.\n\nIn this scenario, you have provided the user with a service portal. This is better for the user because they do not have to worry about isolation, patching, security, backup, and so on. It is better for you because every container that the user deploys is a container VM. You can perform vMotion and monitor container VMs just like all of your other VMs.\nIf the user needs more compute capacity, in Scenario 1, the pragmatic choice is to power down the VM and reconfigure it, or give the user a new VM and let them deal with the clustering implications. Both of these solutions are disruptive to the user. With vSphere Integrated Containers Engine in Scenario 2, you can reconfigure the VCH in vSphere, or redeploy it with a new configuration in a way that is completely transparent to the user.\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine allows you to select and dictate the appropriate infrastructure for the task in hand:\n\nNetworking: You can select multiple port groups for different types of network traffic, ensuring that all of the containers that a user provisions get the appropriate interfaces on the right networks.\nStorage: You can select different vSphere datastores for different types of state. For example, container state is ephemeral and is unlikely to need to be backed up, but volume state almost certainly should be backed up. vSphere Integrated Containers automatically ensures that state gets written to the appropriate datastore when the user provisions a container.\n\nTo summarize, vSphere Integrated Containers Engine gives you a mechanism that allows users to self-provision VMs as containers into your virtual infrastructure.\nWhat Is vSphere Integrated Containers Engine For? \nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine currently offers a subset of the Docker API. It is designed to specifically address the provisioning of containers into production, solving many of the problems highlighted in What Does vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Do?.\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine exploits the portability of the Docker image format to present itself as an enterprise deployment target. Developers build containers on one system and push them to a registry. Containers are tested by another system and are approved for production. vSphere Integrated Containers Engine can then pull the containers out of the registry and deploy them to vSphere.\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine Concepts \nIf you consider a Venn diagram with \"What vSphere Does\" in one circle and \"What Docker Does\" in another, the overlap is significant. The objective of vSphere Integrated Containers Engine is to take as much of vSphere as possible and layer whatever Docker capabilities are missing on top, reusing as much of Docker's own code as possible. The  result should not sacrifice the portability of the Docker image format and should be completely transparent to a Docker client. The following sections describe key concepts and components that make this possible.\n\nContainer VMs \nThe container VMs that vSphere Integrated Containers Engine creates have all of the characteristics of software containers:\n\nAn ephemeral storage layer with optionally attached persistent volumes.\nA custom Linux guest OS that is designed to be \"just a kernel\" and that needs images to be functional.\nA mechanism for persisting and attaching read-only binary image layers.\nA PID 1 guest agent tether extends the control plane into the container VM.\nVarious well-defined methods of configuration and state ingress and egress\nAutomatically configured to various network topologies.\n\nThe provisioned container VM does not contain any OS container abstraction. \n\nThe container VM boots from an ISO that contains the Photon Linux kernel. Note that container VMs do not run the full Photon OS.\nThe container VM is configured with a container image that is mounted as a disk. \nContainer image layers are represented as a read-only VMDK snapshot hierarchy on a vSphere datastore. At the top of this hierarchy is a read-write snapshot that stores ephemeral state. \nContainer volumes are formatted VMDKs that are attached as disks and indexed on a datastore. \nNetworks are distributed port groups that are attached as vNICs.\n\nVirtual Container Hosts \nA virtual container host (VCH) is the functional equivalent of a Linux VM that runs Docker, but with some significant benefits. A VCH represents the following elements:\n\nA clustered pool of resource into which to provision container VMs.\nA single-tenant container namespace.\nAn isolated Docker API endpoint. \nAuthorization to use and configure pre-approved virtual infrastructure.\nA private network that containers are attached to by default.\n\nIf you deploy a VCH in a vCenter Server cluster it spans all of the hosts in the cluster, providing the same flexibility and dynamic use of host resources as is the norm.\nA VCH is functionally distinct from a traditional container host in the following ways:\n\nIt naturally encapsulates clustering and dynamic scheduling by provisioning to vSphere targets.\nThe resource constraints are dynamically configurable with no impact on the containers.\nContainers do not share a kernel.\nThere is no local image cache. This is kept on a datastore in the cluster that you specify when you deploy a VCH. \nThere is no read-write shared storage\n\nA VCH is a multi-functional appliance that you deploy as a vApp in a vCenter Server cluster or as a resource pool on an ESXi host. The vApp or resource pool provides a useful visual parent-child relationship in the vSphere Web Client so that you can easily identify the container VMs that are provisioned into a VCH. You can also specify resource limits on the vApp. You can provision multiple VCHs onto a single ESXi host, into a vSphere resource pool, or into a vCenter Server cluster.\nThe VCH Endpoint VM \nThe VCH endoint VM is the VM that runs inside the VCH vApp or resource pool. There is a 1:1 relationship between a VCH and a VCH endpoint VM. The VCH endpoint VM provides the following functions:\n\nRuns the services that a VCH requires.\nProvides a secure remote API to a client.\nReceives Docker commands and translates those commands into vSphere API calls and vSphere infrastructure constructs.\nProvides network forwarding so that ports to containers can be opened on the VCH endoint VM and the containers can access a public network.\nManages the lifecycle of the containers, the image store, the volume store, and the container state\nProvides logging and monitoring of its own services and of its containers.\n\nThe lifecycle of the VCH endpoint VM is managed by a utility called vic-machine. \nThe vic-machine Utility \nThe vic-machine utility is a binary for Windows, Linux, and OSX that manages the lifecycle of VCHs. vic-machine has been designed for use by vSphere administrators. It takes pre-existing compute, network, storage and a vSphere user as input and creates a VCH as output. It has the following additional functions:\n\nCreates certificates for Docker client TLS authentication.\nChecks that the prerequisites for VCH deployment are met on the cluster or host, namely that the firewall, licenses, and so on are configured correctly.\nConfigures existing VCHs for debugging.\nLists, inspects, upgrades, and deletes VCHs.\n\n"},"vic_vsphere_admin/interop.html":{"url":"vic_vsphere_admin/interop.html","title":"Interoperability with Other VMware Software","keywords":"","body":"Interoperability of vSphere Integrated Containers Engine with Other VMware Software\nvSphere administrators can use vSphere to view and manage virtual container hosts (VCHs) and container VMs. vSphere Integrated Containers Engine works with the following vSphere features and VMware products. \nPerforming Operations on VCHs and Container VMs in vSphere\n\nIf you restart a VCH endpoint VM, it comes back up in the same state that it was in when it shut down. \nIf you shut down the VCH vApp, the VCH endpoint VM and all of the container VMs that it manages are shut down. \nIf you use DHCP on the client network, the IP address of the VCH endpoint VM might change after a restart. Use vic-machine inspect to obtain the new IP address.\nDo not manually delete a VCH vApp or VCH endpoint VM. Use vic-machine delete to delete VCHs.\nManually powering off container VMs can result in incorrect end-times for container opeations. Do not manually delete a contaienr VM. Use Docker commands to perform operations on container VMs.\n\nVMware vRealize® Suite\nYou can use VMware vRealize Automation to provide a self-provisioning service for VCHs, by using the vRealize Automation interface or APIs to request VCHs. At the end of such a provisioning process, vRealize Automation can communicate the VCH endpoint VM address to the requester.\nVMware vSphere vMotion®\nYou can use vMotion to move VCHs without needing to take the container VMs offline. The VCH endpoint VM does not need to be running for vMotion to occur on the container VMs. Clusters with a mix of container VMs and non-container VMs can use vMotion with fully automated DRS. \nMaintenance Mode\nHosts with container VMs can enter maintenance mode without manual intervention, with these exceptions:\n\nFor a standalone ESXi host, you must power down VCHs and any container VMs before entering maintenance mode.\nIn a clustered vSphere environment with DRS set to automatic, DRS migrates VCHs to another host in the cluster before the host enters maintenance mode.\nFor a host with running container VMs, DRS migrates the container VMs to another host in the cluster before the host enters maintenance mode.\nWhen you put a host into maintenance mode, vSphere Integrated Containers Engine powers off container VMs with open sessions. Container VMs that do not have open sessions are migrated to other hosts by vMotion. \n\nVMware vSAN™\nVCHs maintain filesystem layers inherent in container images by mapping to discrete VMDK files, all of which can be housed in shared vSphere datastores, including vSAN, NFS, and iSCSI datastores.\nvCenter Linked Mode Environments\nYou can deploy VCHs in vCenter Linked Mode environments.\nvSphere Features Not Supported in This Release\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine does not currently support the following vSphere features:\n\nvSphere Storage DRS™: You cannot configure VCHs to use Storage DRS datastore clusters. However, you can specify the path to a specific datastore within a Storage DRS datastore cluster by specifying the full inventory path to the datastore in the vic-machine create --image-store option. For example, --image-store /dc1/datastore/my-storage-pod/datastore1. You can also specify the relative path from a datastore folder in a datacenter, for example --image-store my-storage-pod/datastore1.\nvSphere High Availability: You can deploy VCHs to systems that are configured with High Availability, but you cannot use High Availability to fail over the VCHs themselves.\nvSphere Fault Tolerance: You cannot configure Fault Tolerance on VCHs.\nvSphere Virtual Volumes™: You cannot use Virtual Volumes as the target datastores for image stores or volume stores.\nSnapshots: Creating and reverting to snapshots of the VCH endpoint VM or container VMs can cause vSphere Integrated Containers Engine not to function correctly.\n\n"},"vic_vsphere_admin/networks.html":{"url":"vic_vsphere_admin/networks.html","title":"Networks Used by vSphere Integrated Containers Engine","keywords":"","body":"Networks Used by vSphere Integrated Containers Engine\nYou can configure networks on a virtual container host (VCH) that are tied into the vSphere infrastructure. You define which networks are available to a VCH when you deploy the VCH.\nEach network that a VCH uses is a port group on either a vCenter Server instance or ESXi host.\nThis topic provides an overview of the different network types that virtual container hosts use.\n\nHigh-Level View of VCH Networking\nManagement Network\nPublic Network\nClient Network\nBridge Network\nContainer Networks\n\nHigh-Level View of VCH Networking \nThe image below shows a high-level view of the networks that a VCH uses and how they connect to your vSphere environment and to the Docker environment that container developers use. \n \nThe following sections describe each of the VCH network types, that are represented in the image by green elipses. The blue shapes represent   Docker objects, and the gray shapes represent vSphere. \nIMPORTANT: A VCH supports a maximum of 3 distinct network interfaces. The bridge network requires its own port group, at least two of the public, client, and management networks must share a network interface and therefore a port group. Container networks do not go through the VCH, so they are not subject to this limitation. This limitation will be removed in a future release.\nManagement Network \nThe network for communication between the VCH and vCenter Server and ESXi hosts. The VCH uses this network to provide the attach function of the Docker API.\nIMPORTANT: Because the management network provides access to your vSphere environment, and because container VMs use this network to communicate with the VCH, always use a secure network for the management network. Ideally, use separate networks for the management network and the container networks.\nYou define the management network by setting the --management-network option when you run vic-machine create. For more detailed information about management networks, see the section on the --management-network option in VCH Deployment Options.\nPublic Network  \nThe network that container VMs use to connect to the internet. Ports that containers expose with docker create -p when connected to the default bridge network are made available on the public interface of the VCH endpoint VM via network address translation (NAT), so that containers can publish network services.\nYou define the public network by setting the --public-network option when you run vic-machine create. For  more detailed information about management networks, see the section on the --public-network option in VCH Deployment Options.\nClient Network \nThe network on which the VCH endpoint VM makes the Docker API available to Docker clients. The client network isolates the Docker endpoints from the public network.\nYou define the Docker management endpoint network by setting the --client-network option when you run vic-machine create. For  more detailed information about Docker management endpoint networks, see the section on the --client-network option in VCH Deployment Options.\nBridge Network \nThe network or networks that container VMs use to communicate with each other. Each VCH requires a unique bridge network. The bridge network is a port group on a distributed virtual switch.\nIMPORTANT: Do not use the bridge network for any other VM workloads, or as a bridge for more than one VCH.\nYou define the bridge networks by setting the --bridge-network option when you run vic-machine create.  For  more detailed information about bridge networks, see the section on the --bridge-network option in VCH Deployment Options.\nContainer application developers can also use docker network create to create additional bridge networks. These networks are represented by the User-Created Bridge Network in the image above. Additional bridge networks are created by IP address segregation and are not new port groups. You can define a range of IP addresses that additional bridge networks can use by defining the bridge-network-range option when you run vic-machine create. For  more detailed information about  how to set bridge network ranges, see the section on the bridge-network-range option. \nContainer Networks \nContainer networks allow the vSphere administrator to make vSphere networks directly available to containers. This is done during deployment of a VCH by providing a mapping of the vSphere network name to an alias that is used inside the VCH endpoint VM. The mapped networks are then listed as available by the Docker API. Running docker network ls shows these networks, and container developers can attach them to containers in the normal way by using commands such as docker run or create, with the --network=_mapped-network-name_ or docker network connect. The containers connected to container networks are connected directly to these networks, and traffic does not route though the VCH endpoint VM using NAT.\nYou can share one network alias between multiple containers. For  more detailed information about setting up container networks, see the sections on the container-network-xxx options in Virtual Container Host Deployment Options. \n"},"vic_vsphere_admin/download_vic.html":{"url":"vic_vsphere_admin/download_vic.html","title":"Download vSphere Integrated Containers","keywords":"","body":"Download vSphere Integrated Containers\nYou can download different versions of vSphere Integrated Containers, that have different levels of stability and support.\nOfficial Releases\nTo obtain the latest official release of vSphere Integrated Containers, go to http://www.vmware.com/go/download-vic.

Installation fails if your environment includes one or more ESXi hosts that have inadequate licenses. \nESXi Host Firewall Requirements \nTo be valid targets for VCHs and container VMs, ESXi hosts must have the following firewall configuration:\n\nAllow outbound TCP traffic to port 2377 on the endpoint VM, for use by the interactive container shell.\nAllow inbound HTTPS/TCP traffic on port 443, for uploading to and downloading from datastores.\n\nThese requirements apply to standalone ESXi hosts and to ESXi hosts in vCenter Server clusters.\nFor information about how to open ports on ESXi hosts, see VCH Deployment Fails with Firewall Validation Error.\nESXi Host Storage Requirements for vCenter Server Clusters \nESXi hosts in vCenter Server clusters must meet the following storage requirements in order to be usable by a VCH:\n\nBe attached to the datastores that you will use for image stores and volume stores. \nHave access to shared storage to allow VCHs to use more than one host in the cluster.\n\nFor information about image stores and volumes stores, see the Datastore Options section of VCH Deployment Options.\nGeneral Network Requirements \nThe following network requirements apply to deployment of VCHs to standalone ESXi hosts and to vCenter Server:\n\nUse a trusted network for the deployment and use of vSphere Integrated Containers Engine.\nUse a trusted network for the management network.\nConnections between Docker clients and the VCH are encrypted via TLS unless you explicitly disable TLS. The client network does not need to be trusted.\nEach VCH requires an IPv4 address on each of the networks that it is connected to. The bridge network is handled internally, but other interfaces must have a static IP configured on them, or be able to acquire one via DHCP.\nEach VCH requires access to at least one network, for use as the public network. You can share this network between multiple VCHs. The public network does not need to be trusted.\nDo not share the bridge network interface with with any other network, unless you ensure that the bridge IP ranges do not conflict with other VCHs or VMs on that network. It is highly recommended that a bridge network be solely for use by only one VCH.\n\nvCenter Server Network Requirements \nThe following network requirements apply to the deployment of VCHs to vCenter Server: \n\nCreate a distributed virtual switch with a port group for each VCH, for use as the bridge network. You can create multiple port groups on the same distributed virtual switch, but each VCH requires its own port group for the bridge network.\nOptionally create port groups for use as mapped container networks.  \nAll hosts in a cluster must be attached to the port groups that you will use for the VCH bridge network and for any mapped container networks.\nIsolate the bridge network and any mapped container networks. You can isolate networks by using a separate VLAN for each network. \n\nFor information about bridge networks and container networks, see the --bridge-network and --container-network options in VCH Deployment Options. \nFor information about how to create a distributed virtual switch and a port group, see Create a vSphere Distributed Switch in the vSphere  documentation. \nFor information about how to add hosts to a distributed virtual switch, see Add Hosts to a vSphere Distributed Switch in the vSphere  documentation.\nFor information about how to assign a VLAN ID to a port group, see VMware KB 1003825.

In this case, you do not need to specify a compute resource when you run vic-machine create. If you are deploying to an ESXi host and you do not specify --compute-resource, vic-machine create automatically uses the default resource pool. \nYou specify the --compute-resource option in the following circumstances:\n\nA vCenter Server instance includes multiple instances of standalone hosts or clusters, or a mixture of standalone hosts and clusters.\nYou want to deploy the VCH to a specific resource pool in your environment. \n\nIf you do not specify the --compute-resource option and multiple possible resources exist, or if you specify an invalid resource name, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid targets for --compute-resource in the failure message. \n\nTo deploy to a specific resource pool on an ESXi host, specify the name of the resource pool: --compute-resource  resource_pool_name\nTo deploy to a vCenter Server instance that has more than one standalone host that are not part of a cluster, specify the IPv4 address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the target host:--compute-resource host_address\nTo deploy to a vCenter Server with more than one cluster, specify the name of the target cluster: --compute-resource cluster_name\nTo deploy to a specific resource pool on a standalone host that is managed by vCenter Server, specify the IPv4 address or FQDN of the target host and name of the resource pool:--compute-resource host_name/resource_pool_name\nTo deploy to a specific resource pool in a cluster, specify the names of the target cluster and the resource pool:--compute-resource cluster_name/resource_pool_name\nWrap the resource names in single quotes (') on Mac OS and Linux and in double quotes (\") on Windows if they include spaces:--compute-resource 'cluster name'/'resource pool name'\n\n--thumbprint \nShort name: None\nThe thumbprint of the vCenter Server or ESXi host certificate. Specify this option if your vSphere environment uses untrusted, self-signed certificates. If your vSphere environment uses trusted certificates that are signed by a known Certificate Authority (CA), you do not need to specify the --thumbprint option.\nNOTE If your vSphere environment uses untrusted, self-signed certificates, you can run vic-machine create without the --thumbprint option by using the --force option. However, running vic-machine create with the --force option rather than providing the certificate thumbprint is not recommended, because it permits man-in-the-middle attacks to go undetected.\nTo obtain the thumbprint of the vCenter Server or ESXi host certificate, run vic-machine create without the specifying the --thumbprint or --force options. The deployment of the VCH fails, but the resulting error message includes the required certificate thumbprint. You can copy the thumbprint from the error message and run vic-machine create again, including the --thumbprint option. If you obtain the thumbprint by other means, use upper-case letters and colon delimitation rather than space delimitation when you specify --thumbprint.\n--thumbprint certificate_thumbprint\n\n\nSecurity Options \nAs a convenience, vic-machine create provides the option of generating a client certificate, server certificate, and certificate authority (CA) as appropriate when you deploy a VCH. The generated certificates are functional, but they do not allow for fine control over aspects such as expiration, intermediate certificate authorities, and so on. To exercise fine control over the certificates used, obtain or generate custom certificates yourself before deploying a VCH. Use the --key, --cert, and --tls-ca options to pass the custom certificates to vic-machine create.\nRestrict access to the Docker API\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine authenticates Docker API clients by using client certificates. This configuration is commonly referred to as tlsverify in documentation about containers and Docker. A client certificate is accepted if it is signed by a CA that you provide by specifying one or more instances of the --tls-ca option. In the case of the certificates that vic-machine create generates, vic-machine create creates a CA and uses it to create and sign a single client certificate.\nWhen using the Docker client, the client validates the server either by using CAs that are present in the root certificate bundle of the client system, or that are provided explicitly by using the --tlscacert option when running Docker commands. As a part of this validation, the server certificate must explicitly state at least one of the following, and must match the name or address that the client uses to access the server:\n\nThe FQDN used to communicate with the server\nThe IP address used to communicate with the server\nA wildcard domain that matches all of the FQDNs in a specific subdomain. For an example of a domain wildcard, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_certificate#Example.\n\n--tls-cname \nShort name: None\nThe FQDN or IP address to embed in the generated server certificate. Specify an FQDN, IP address, or a domain wildcard. If you provide a  custom server certificate by using the --cert option, you can use --tls-cname as a sanity check to ensure that the certificate is valid for the deployment.\nIf you do not specify --tls-cname but you do set a static address for the VCH on the client network interface, vic-machine create uses that  address for the Common Name, with the same results as if you had specified --tls-cname=x.x.x.x. For information about setting a static IP address on the client network, see Options for Specifying a Static IP Address for the VCH Endpoint VM.\nWhen you specify the --tls-cname option, vic-machine create performs the following actions during the deployment of the VCH:\n\nChecks for an existing certificate in either a folder that has the same name as the VCH that you are deploying, or in a location that you specify in the --cert-path option. If a valid certificate exists that includes the same Common Name attribute as the one that you specify in --tls-cname, vic-machine create reuses it. Reusing certificates allows you to delete and recreate VCHs for which you have already distributed the certificates to container developers.\nIf certificates are present in the certificate folder that include a different Common Name attribute to the one that you specify in --tls-cname, vic-machine create fails.  \nIf a certificate folder does not exist, vic-machine create creates a folder with the same name as the VCH, or creates a folder in the location that you specify in the --cert-path option. \nIf valid certificates do not already exist, vic-machine create creates the following trusted CA, server, and client certificate/key pairs in the certificate folder:\nca.pem\nca-key.pem\ncert.pem\nkey.pem\nserver-cert.pem\nserver-key.pem\n\n\nCreates a browser-friendly PFX client certificate, cert.pfx, to use to authenticate connections to the VCH Admin portal for the VCH.\n\nNOTE: The folder and file permissions for the generated certificate and key are readable only by the user who created them.\nRunning vic-machine create with the --tls-cname option also creates an environment file named vch_name.env, that contains Docker environment variables that container developers can use to configure their Docker client environment:\n\nActivates TLS client verification.DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1\nThe path to the client certificates.DOCKER_CERT_PATH=path_to_certs\nThe address of the VCH.DOCKER_HOST=vch_address:2376\n\nYou must provide copies of the cert.pem and key.pem client certificate files and the environment file to container developers so that they can connect Docker clients to the VCH. If you deploy the VCH with the --tls-cname option, container developers must configure the client appropriately with one of the following options:\n\nBy using the following tlsverify, tlscert, and tlskey Docker options, adding tlscacert if a custom CA was used to sign the server certificate.\nBy setting DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/path/to/client/cert.pem and DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1.\n\n--tls-cname vch-name.example.org\n--tls-cname *.example.org\n\n\n--tls-ca \nShort name: --ca\nYou can specify --tls-ca multiple times, to point vic-machine create to a file that contains the public portion of a CA. vic-machine create uses these CAs to validate client certificates that are offered as credentials for Docker API access. This does not need to be the same CA that you use to sign the server certificate.\n--tls-ca path_to_ca_file\n\nNOTE: The --tls-ca option appears in the extended help that you see by running vic-machine-os create --extended-help or vic-machine-os create -x.\nUnrestricted access to the Docker API\nTo deploy a VCH that does not restrict access to the Docker API,  use the --no-tlsverify option. \n--no-tlsverify \nShort name: --kv\nThe --no-tlsverify option prevents the use of CAs for client authentication. You still require a server certificate if you use --no-tlsverify. You can supply a custom server certificate by using the  --cert and --key  options. If you do not use --cert and --key to supply a custom server certificate, vic-machine create generates a self-signed server certificate.\nWhen you specify the --no-tlsverify option, vic-machine create performs the following actions during the deployment of the VCH.\n\nGenerates a self-signed server certificate if you do not specify --cert and --key.\nCreates a folder with the same name as the VCH in the location in which you run vic-machine create.\nCreates an environment file named vch_name.env in that folder, that contains the DOCKER_HOST=vch_address environment variable, that you can provide to container developers to use to set up their Docker client environment.\n\nIf you deploy a VCH with the --no-tlsverify option, container developers run Docker commands with the --tls option, and the DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY environment variable must not be set. Note that setting DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY to 0 or false has no effect. \nThe --no-tlsverify option takes no arguments. \n--no-tlsverify\n\n\nPrivate Registry Options \nIf container developers need to access Docker images that are stored in private registry servers, you must configure VCHs to allow them to connect to the private registry servers when you deploy the VCHs. VCHs can connect to both secure and insecure private registry servers.\n--registry-ca \nShort name: --rc\nThe path to a CA certificate that can validate the registry's server certificate. You can specify --registry-ca multiple times to specify multiple CA certificates for different registries. The use of these certificates is independent of the client security options that you specify. For example, it is possible to disable TLS for client authentication by using --no-tls, and to use --registry-ca tospecify CA certificates to validate a private registry.\n--registry-ca path_to_ca_cert_1\n--registry-ca path_to_ca_cert_2\n\n\nNOTE: The --registry-ca option appears in the extended help that you see by running vic-machine-os create --extended-help or vic-machine-os create -x.\n--insecure-registry \nShort name: --dir\nAn insecure private registry server is a private registry server for Docker images that does not provide TLS. The VCH cannot confirm the identity of the remote system that it is pulling images from and the communication is not encrypted. Insecure private registries are not recommended in production environments.  \nIf you authorize a VCH to connect to an insecure private registry server, the VCH attempts to access the registry server via HTTP if access via HTTPS fails. VCHs always use HTTPS when connecting to registry servers for which you have not authorized insecure access.\nTo permit pulling images from an insecure private registry, use the --insecure-registry option. You can specify --insecure-registry multiple times if multiple insecure registries are permitted. If the registry server listens on a specific port, add the port number to the URL\n--insecure-registry registry_URL_1\n--insecure-registry registry_URL_2:port_number\n\n\n\nDatastore Options \nThe vic-machine utility allows you to specify the datastore in which to store container image files, container VM files, and the files for the VCH. You can also specify datastores in which to create container volumes. \n\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine fully supports VMware vSAN datastores. \nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine supports all alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores in datastore paths and datastore names, but no other special characters.\nIf you specify different datastores in the different datastore options, and if no single host in a cluster can access all of those datastores, vic-machine create fails with an error.No single host can access all of the requested datastores. \nInstallation cannot continue.\nIf you specify different datastores in the different datastore options, and if only one host in a cluster can access all of them, vic-machine create succeeds with a warning.Only one host can access all of the image/container/volume datastores. \nThis may be a point of contention/performance degradation and HA/DRS \nmay not work as intended. \nVCHs do not support datastore name changes. If a datastore changes name after you have deployed a VCH that uses that datastore, that VCH will no longer function.\n\n--image-store \nShort name: -i\nThe datastore in which to store container image files, container VM files, and the files for the VCH. The --image-store option is mandatory if there is more than one datastore in your vSphere environment. If there is only one datastore in your vSphere environment, the --image-store option is not required. \nIf you do not specify the --image-store option and multiple possible datastores exist, or if you specify an invalid datastore name, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid datastores in the failure message. \nIf you are deploying the VCH to a vCenter Server cluster, the datastore that you designate in the image-store option must be shared by at least two ESXi hosts in the cluster. Using non-shared datastores is possible, but limits the use of vSphere features such as vSphere vMotion® and VMware vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler™ (DRS).\nTo specify a whole datastore as the image store, specify the datastore name in the --image-store option:\n--image-store datastore_name\n\nIf you designate a whole datastore as the image store, vic-machine creates the following set of folders in the target datastore: \n\ndatastore_name/VIC/vch_uuid/images, in which to store all of the container images that you pull into the VCH.\ndatastore_name/vch_name, that contains the VM files for the VCH.\ndatastore_name/vch_name/kvstores, a key-value store folder for the VCH.\n\nYou can specify a datastore folder to use as the image store by specifying a path in the --image-store option: \n--image-store datastore_name/path \n\nIf the folder that you specify in /path does not already exist, vic-machine create creates it. Wrap the datastore name and path in single quotes (') on Mac OS and Linux and in double quotes (\") on Windows if they include spaces:  --image-store 'datastore name'/'datastore path'  \nIf you designate a datastore folder as the image store, vic-machine creates the following set of folders in the target datastore:\n\ndatastore_name/path/VIC/vcu_uuid/images, in which to store all of the container images that you pull into the VCH. \ndatastore_name/vch_name, that contains the VM files for the VCH. This is the same as if you specified a datastore as the image store.\ndatastore_name/vch_name/kvstores, a key-value store folder for the VCH. This is the same as if you specified a datastore as the image store.\n\nBy specifying the path to a datastore folder in the --image-store option, you can designate the same datastore folder as the image store for multiple VCHs. In this way, vic-machine create creates only one VIC folder in the datastore, at the path that you specify. The VIC folder contains one vch_uuid/images folder for each VCH that you deploy. By creating one vch_uuid/images folder for each VCH, vSphere Integrated Containers Engine limits the potential for conflicts of image use between VCHs, even if you share the same image store folder between multiple hosts.\nWhen container developers create containers, vSphere Integrated Containers Engine stores the files for container VMs at the top level of the image store, in folders that have the same name as the containers.\n--volume-store \nShort name: --vs\nThe datastore in which to create volumes when container developers use the docker volume create or docker create -v commands. When you specify the volume-store option, you  provide the name of the target datastore and a label for the volume store. You can optionally provide a path to a specific folder in the datastore in which to create the volume store. If the folders that you specify in the path do not already exist on the datastore, vic-machine create creates the appropriate folder structure. \nThe vic-machine create creates command creates the volumes folder independently from the folders for VCH files so that you can share volumes between VCHs. If you delete a VCH, any volumes that the VCH managed will remain available in the volume store unless you specify the --force option when you delete the VCH. You can then assign an existing volume store that already contains data to a newly created VCH. \nIMPORTANT: If multiple VCHs will use the same datastore for their volume stores, specify a different datastore folder for each VCH. Do not designate the same datastore folder as the volume store for multiple VCHs.\nIf you are deploying the VCH to a vCenter Server cluster, the datastore that you designate in the volume-store option should be shared by at least two ESXi hosts in the cluster. Using non-shared datastores is possible and vic-machine create succeeds, but it issues a warning that this configuration limits the use of vSphere features such as vSphere vMotion and DRS.\nThe label that you specify is the volume store name that Docker uses. For example, the volume store label appears in the information for a VCH when container developers run docker info. Container developers specify the volume store label in the docker volume create --opt VolumeStore=volume_store_label option when they create a volume.\nIf you specify an invalid datastore name, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid datastores. \nIMPORTANT If you do not specify the volume-store option, no  volume store is created and container developers cannot use the docker volume create or docker create -v commands.\n\nIf you only require one volume store, you can set the volume store label to default. If you set the volume store label to default, container developers do not need to specify the --opt VolumeStore=volume_store_label option when they run docker volume create. \nNOTE: If container developers intend to use docker create -v to create containers that are attached to anonymous or named volumes, you must create a volume store with a label of default.\n--volume-store datastore_name:default\n\nIf you specify the target datastore and the volume store label, vic-machine create creates a folder named VIC/volumes at the top level of the target datastore. Any volumes that container developers create will appear in the VIC/volumes folder. \n--volume-store datastore_name:volume_store_label\nIf you specify the target datastore, a datastore path, and the volume store label, vic-machine create creates a folder named volumes in the location that you specify in the datastore path. Any volumes that container developers create will appear in the path/volumes folder.\n--volume-store datastore_name/datastore_path:volume_store_label\nWrap the datastore name and path in single quotes (') on Mac OS and Linux and in double quotes (\") on Windows if they include spaces. The volume store label cannot include spaces.\n--volume-store 'datastore name'/'datastore path':volume_store_label\nYou can specify the volume-store option multiple times, to create multiple volume stores for the VCH.\n--volume-store datastore_name/path:volume_store_label_1\n--volume-store datastore_name/path:volume_store_label_2\n[...]\n--volume-store datastore_name/path:volume_store_label_n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworking Options \nThe vic-machine create utility allows you to specify different networks for the different types of traffic between containers, the VCH, the external internet, and your vSphere environment. For information about the different networks that VCHs use, see Networks Used by vSphere Integrated Containers Engine.\nIMPORTANT: A VCH supports a maximum of 3 distinct network interfaces. Because the bridge network requires its own port group, at least two of the public, client, and management networks must share a network interface and therefore a port group. Container networks do not go through the VCH, so they are not subject to this limitation. This limitation will be removed in a future release.\nBy default, vic-machine create obtains IP addresses for VCH endpoint VMs by using DHCP. For information about how to specify a static IP address for the VCH endpoint VM on the client, public, and management networks, see Specify a Static IP Address for the VCH Endpoint VM in Advanced Options.\nIf your network access is controlled by a proxy server, see Options to Configure VCHs to Use Proxy Servers in Advanced Options. \nWhen you specify different network interfaces for the different types of traffic, vic-machine create checks that the firewalls on the ESXi hosts allow connections to port 2377 from those networks. If access to port 2377 on one or more ESXi hosts is subject to IP address restrictions, and if those restrictions block access to the network interfaces that you specify, vic-machine create fails with a firewall configuration error:\nFirewall configuration incorrect due to allowed IP restrictions on hosts: \n\"/ha-datacenter/host/localhost.localdomain/localhost.localdomain\" \nFirewall must permit dst 2377/tcp outbound to the VCH management interface\n\n\n\n--bridge-network \nShort name: -b\nA port group that container VMs use to communicate with each other. \nThe bridge-network option is mandatory if you are deploying a VCH to vCenter Server.\nIn a vCenter Server environment, before you run vic-machine create, you must create a distributed virtual switch and a port group. You must add the target ESXi host or hosts to the distributed virtual switch, and assign a VLAN ID to the port group, to ensure that the bridge network is isolated. For information about how to create a distributed virtual switch and port group, see the section on vCenter Server Network Requirements in Environment Prerequisites for VCH Deployment.\nYou pass the name of the port group to the bridge-network option. Each VCH requires its own port group. \nIMPORTANT \n\nDo not assign the same bridge-network port group to multiple VCHs. Sharing a port group between VCHs might result in multiple container VMs being assigned the same IP address. \nDo not use the bridge-network port group as the target for any of the other vic-machine create networking options.\n\nIf you specify an invalid port group name, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid port groups.\nThe bridge-network option is optional when you are deploying a VCH to an ESXi host with no vCenter Server. In this case, if you do not specify bridge-network, vic-machine creates a  virtual switch and a port group that each have the same name as the VCH. You can optionally specify this option to assign an existing port group for use as the bridge network for container VMs. You can also optionally specify this option to create a new virtual switch and port group that have a different name to the VCH.\n--bridge-network port_group_name\n\nWrap the port group name in single quotes (') on Mac OS and Linux and in double quotes (\") on Windows if it includes spaces.\n--bridge-network 'port group name'\n\nIf you intend to use the --ops-user option to use different user accounts for deployment and operation of the VCH, you must place the bridge network port group in a network folder that has the Read-Only role with propagation enabled. For more information about the requirements when using --ops-user, see Use Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation. If the port group is located in a network folder, include the full inventory path to the port group when you specify the --bridge-network option.\n--bridge-network 'datacenter/network/network_folder/port_group_name'\n\nFor information about how to specify a range of IP addresses for additional bridge networks, see bridge-network-range in Advanced Networking Options.\n--client-network \nShort name: --cln\nA port group on which the VCH will make the Docker API available to Docker clients. Docker clients use this network to issue Docker API requests to the VCH.\nIf not specified, the VCH uses the public network for client traffic. If you specify an invalid port group name, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid port groups.\n--client-network port_group_name\n\nWrap the port group name in single quotes (') on Mac OS and Linux and in double quotes (\") on Windows if it includes spaces.\n--client-network 'port group name'\n\n\n--public-network \nShort name: --pn\nA port group for containers to use to connect to the Internet. VCHs use the public network to pull container images, for example from https://hub.docker.com/. Containers that use use port mapping expose network services on the public interface. \nNOTE: vSphere Integrated Containers Engine adds a new capability to Docker that allows you to directly map containers to a network by using the --container-network option. This is the recommended way to deploy container services.\nIf not specified, containers use the VM Network for public network traffic. If you specify an invalid port group name, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid port groups.\n--public-network port_group\n\nWrap the network name in single quotes (') on Mac OS and Linux and in double quotes (\") on Windows if it includes spaces.\n--public-network 'port group name'\n\n\n--management-network \nShort name: --mn\nA port group that the VCH uses to communicate with vCenter Server and ESXi hosts. Container VMs use this network to communicate with the VCH. \nIMPORTANT: Because the management network provides access to your vSphere environment, and because container VMs use this network to communicate with the VCH, always use a secure network for the management network.\nWhen you create a VCH, vic-machine create checks that the firewall on ESXi hosts allows connections to port 2377 from the management network of the VCH. If access to port 2377 on ESXi hosts is subject to IP address restrictions, and if those restrictions block access to the management network interface, vic-machine create fails with a firewall configuration error:\nFirewall configuration incorrect due to allowed IP restrictions on hosts: \n\"/ha-datacenter/host/localhost.localdomain/localhost.localdomain\" \nFirewall must permit dst 2377/tcp outbound to the VCH management interface\n\n\nNOTE: If the management network uses DHCP, vic-machine checks the firewall status of the management network before the VCH receives an IP address. It is therefore not possible to fully assess whether the firewall permits the IP address of the VCH. In this case, vic-machine create issues a warning. \nUnable to fully verify firewall configuration due to DHCP use on management network \nVCH management interface IP assigned by DHCP must be permitted by allowed IP settings \nFirewall allowed IP configuration may prevent required connection on hosts: \n\"/ha-datacenter/host/localhost.localdomain/localhost.localdomain\" \nFirewall must permit dst 2377/tcp outbound to the VCH management interface\n\n\nIf not specified, the VCH uses the public network for management traffic. If you specify an invalid port group name, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid port groups.\n--management-network port_group_name\n\nWrap the network name in single quotes (') on Mac OS and Linux and in double quotes (\") on Windows if it includes spaces.\n--management-network 'port group name'\n\n\n--container-network \nShort name: --cn\nA port group for container VMs to use for external communication when container developers  run docker run or docker create with the --net option. \nYou can optionally specify one or more container networks. Container networks allow containers to directly attach to a network without having to route through the VCH via network address translation (NAT). Container networks that you add by using the --container-network option appear when you run the docker network ls command. These networks are available for use by containers. Containers that use these networks are directly attached to the container network, and do not go through the VCH or share the public IP of the VCH.\nIMPORTANT: For security reasons, whenever possible, use separate port groups for the container network and the management network.\nTo specify a container network, you provide the name of a port group for the container VMs to use, and an optional descriptive name for the container network for use by Docker.  If you do not specify a descriptive name, Docker uses the vSphere network name. If you specify an invalid port group name, vic-machine create fails and suggests valid port groups.\n\nYou can specify a vSphere network as the container network.\nThe port group must exist before you run vic-machine create. \nYou cannot use the same port group as you use for the bridge network. \nYou can create the port group on the same distributed virtual switch as the port group that you use for the bridge network.\nIf the port group that you specify in the container-network option does not support DHCP, see Options for Configuring a Non-DHCP Network for Container Traffic in Advanced Options. \nThe descriptive name appears under Networks when you run docker info or docker network ls on the deployed VCH.\nContainer developers use the descriptive name in the --net option when they run docker run or docker create.\n\nYou can specify --container-network multiple times to add multiple vSphere networks to Docker.\nIf you do not specify --container-network, or if you deploy containers that do not use a container network, the containers' network services are still be available via port mapping through the VCH, by using NAT through the public interface of the VCH.\n--container-network port_group_name:container_port _group_name\n\nWrap the port group name in single quotes (') on Mac OS and Linux and in double quotes (\") on Windows if it includes spaces. The descriptive name cannot include spaces.\n--container-network 'port group name':container port group name\n\nIf you intend to use the --ops-user option to use different user accounts for deployment and operation of the VCH, you must place any container network port groups in a network folder that has the Read-Only role with propagation enabled. For more information about the requirements when using --ops-user, see Use Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation. If a port group is located in a network folder, include the full inventory path to the port group when you specify the --container-network option.\n--container-network 'datacenter/network/network_folder/port_group_name':container_port _group_name\n\n\nAdditional Deployment Options \nThe vic-machine utility provides options to customize the VCH.\n--name\nShort name: -n\nA name for the VCH. If not specified, vic-machine sets the name of the VCH to virtual-container-host. If a VCH of the same name exists on the ESXi host or in the vCenter Server inventory, or if a folder of the same name exists in the target datastore, vic-machine create creates a folder named vch_name_1\n--name vch_name\n\nWrap the name in single quotes (') on Mac OS and Linux and in double quotes (\") on Windows if it includes spaces.\n--name 'vch name'\n\n--memory\nShort name: --mem\nLimit the amount of memory that is available for use by the VCH vApp in vCenter Server, or for the VCH resource pool on an ESXi host. This limit also applies to the container VMs that run in the VCH vApp or resource pool. Specify the memory limit value in MB. If not specified, vic-machine create sets the limit to 0 (unlimited).\n--memory 1024\n\n--cpu\nShort name: None\nLimit the amount of CPU capacity that is available for use by the VCH vApp in vCenter Server, or for the VCH resource pool on an ESXi host. This limit also applies to the container VMs that run in the VCH vApp or resource pool. Specify the CPU limit value in MHz. If not specified, vic-machine create sets the limit to 0 (unlimited).\n--cpu 1024\n\n--force\nShort name: -f\nForces vic-machine create to ignore warnings and non-fatal errors and continue with the deployment of a VCH. Errors such as an incorrect compute resource still cause the installation to fail.\nIf your vSphere environment uses untrusted, self-signed certificates, you can use the --force option to deploy a VCH without providing the thumbprint of the vCenter Server or ESXi host in the thumbprint option. \nIMPORTANT Running vic-machine create with the --force option rather than providing the certificate thumbprint is not recommended, because it permits man-in-the-middle attacks to go undetected.\n--force\n\n--timeout\nShort name: none\nThe timeout period for uploading the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine files and ISOs to the ESXi host, and for powering on the VCH. Specify a value in the format XmYs if the default timeout of 3m0s is insufficient.\n--timeout 5m0s \n\n\nAdvanced Options \nThe options in this section are exposed in the vic-machine create help if you run vic-machine-operating_system create --extended-help, or vic-machine-operating_system create -x. \nAdvanced Security Options \nThe advanced security options allow you to customize the authentication of connections from Docker clients to VCHs.\n\nAdd optional information to auto-generated trusted TLS certificates by specifying the --certificate-key-size, and --organization options.\nUse custom server certificates by using the --cert and --key options.\nDisable TLS authentication completely by using the --no-tls option.\n\n--certificate-key-size\nShort name: --ksz\nThe size of the key for vic-machine create to use when it creates auto-generated trusted certificates. If not specified, vic-machine create creates keys with default size of 2048 bits. It is not recommended to use key sizes of less than 2048 bits.\n--certificate-key-size 3072\n\n--organization\nShort name: None\nA list of identifiers to record in certificates generated by vic-machine. If not specified,vic-machine create uses the name of the VCH as the organization value.\nNOTE: The client-ip-address is used for CommonName but not  for  Organisation.\n--organization organization_name\n\n\n--cert \nShort name: none\nThe path to a custom X.509 server certificate. This certificate identifies the VCH endpoint VM both to Docker clients and to browsers  that connect to the VCH Admin portal.\n\nThis certificate should have the following certificate usages:\nKeyEncipherment\nDigitalSignature\nKeyAgreement\nServerAuth\n\n\nThis option is mandatory if you use custom TLS certificates, rather than auto-generated certificates.\nUse this option in combination with the --key option, that provides the path to the private key file for the custom certificate.\nInclude the names of the certificate and key files in the paths.\nIf you use trusted custom certificates, container developers run Docker commands with the --tlsverify, --tlscacert, --tlscert, and --tlskey options.\n\n--cert path_to_certificate_file/certificate_file_name.pem \n--key path_to_key_file/key_file_name.pem\n \n\nWrap the folder names in the paths in single quotes (Linux or Mac OS) or double quotes (Windows) if they include spaces.\n--cert 'path to certificate file'/certificate_file_name.pem \n--key 'path to key file'/key_file_name.pem\n \n\n\n--key \nShort name: none\nThe path to the private key file to use with a custom server certificate. This option is mandatory if you specify the --cert option, that provides the path to a custom X.509 certificate file. Include the names of the certificate and key files in the paths. \n--cert path_to_certificate_file/certificate_file_name.pem \n--key path_to_key_file/key_file_name.pem\n \n\nWrap the folder names in the paths in single quotes (Linux or Mac OS) or double quotes (Windows) if they include spaces.\n--cert 'path to certificate file'/certificate_file_name.pem \n--key 'path to key file'/key_file_name.pem\n\n\n\n--cert-path \nShort name: none\nBy default --cert-path is a folder in the current directory, that takes its name from the VCH name that you specify in the --name option. vic-machine create checks in --cert-path for existing certificates with the standard names and uses those certificates if  they are present:\n\nserver-cert.pem \nserver-key.pem\nca.pem\n\nIf vic-machine create does not find existing certificates with the standard names in --cert-path, or if you do not specify certificates directly by using the --cert, --key, and --tls-ca options, vic-machine create generates certificates. Generated certificates are saved in the --cert-path folder with the standard names listed. vic-machine create additionally generates other certificates:\n\ncert.pem and key.pem for client certificates, if required.\nca-key.pem, the private key for the certificate authority. \n\n--cert-path 'path_to_certificate_folder'\n\n\n\n--no-tls \nShort name: -k\nDisables TLS authentication of connections between the Docker client and  the VCH. \nSet the no-tls option if you do not require TLS authentication between the VCH and the Docker client. Any Docker client can connect to the VCH if you disable TLS authentication. \nIf you use the no-tls option, container developers connect Docker clients to the VCH via port 2375, instead of via port 2376.\n--no-tls\n\n\n--ops-user \nShort name: None\nA vSphere user account with which the VCH runs after deployment. Because deploying a VCH requires greater levels of permissions than running a VCH, you can configure a VCH so that it uses different user accounts for deployment and for operation. In this way, you can limit the day-to-day operation of a VCH to an account that does not have full administrator permissions on the target vCenter Server.\nIf not specified, the VCH runs with the vSphere Administrator credentials with which you deploy the VCH, that you specify in either --target or --user.\n--ops-user user_name\n\nWrap the user name in single quotes (') on Mac OS and Linux and in double quotes (\") on Windows if it includes special characters.\n--ops-user 'user_n@me'\n\nThe user account that you specify in --ops-user must exist before you deploy the VCH. For information about the permissions that the --ops-user account requires, see Use Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation.\n--ops-password\nShort name: None\nThe password or token for the operations user that you specify in --ops-user.\nIf not specified, vic-machine create prompts you to enter the password for the --ops-user account.\n--ops-password password\n\nWrap the password in single quotes (') on Mac OS and Linux and in double quotes (\") on Windows if it includes special characters.\n--ops-password 'p@ssword'\n\n\n\nOptions for Specifying a Static IP Address for the VCH Endpoint VM \nYou can specify a static IP address for the VCH endpoint VM on each of the client, public, and management networks. DHCP is used for the endpoint VM for any network on which you do not specify a static IP address.\nTo specify a static IP address for the endpoint VM on the client, public, or management network, you provide an IP address in the client/public/management-network-ip option. If you set a static IP address, you can optionally provide gateway addresses and specify one or more DNS server addresses.\n--dns-server\nShort name: None\nA DNS server for the VCH endpoint VM to use on the client, public, or management networks. You can specify dns-server multiple times, to configure multiple DNS servers.  \n\nIf you specify dns-server, vic-machine create always uses the --dns-server setting for all three of the client, public, and management networks.\nIf you do not specify dns-server and you specify a static IP address for the endpoint VM on all three of the client, public, and management networks, vic-machine create uses the Google public DNS service. \nIf you do not specify dns-server and you use a mixture of static IP addresses and DHCP for the client, public, and management networks, vic-machine create uses the DNS servers that DHCP provides.\nIf you do not specify dns-server and you use DHCP for all of the client, public, and management networks, vic-machine create uses the DNS servers that DHCP provides.\n\n--dns-server=172.16.10.10\n--dns-server=172.16.10.11\n\n\n--client-network-ip, --public-network-ip, --management-network-ip\nShort name: None\nA static IP address for the VCH endpoint VM on the public, client, or management network. \nYou specify a static IP address for the endpoint VM on the public, client, or management networks by using the --public/client/management-network-ip options. If you set a static IP address for the endpoint VM on the public network, you must specify a corresponding gateway address by using the --public-network-gateway option. If the management and client networks are L2 adjacent to their gateways, you do not need to specify the gateway for those networks.\n\nYou can only specify one static IP address on a given port group. If more than one of the client, public, or management networks share a port group, you can only specify a static IP address on one of those networks. All of the networks that share that port group use the IP address that you specify. \nIf either of the client or management networks shares a port group with the public network, you can only specify a static IP address on the public network.\nIf either or both of the client or management networks do not use the same port group as the public network, you can specify a static IP address for the endpoint VM on those networks by using --client-network-ip or --management-network-ip, or both. In this case, you must specify a corresponding gateway address by using client/management-network-gateway. \nIf the client and management networks both use the same port group, and the public network does not use that port group, you can set a static IP address for the endpoint VM on either or both of the client and management networks.\nIf you assign a static IP address to the VCH endpoint VM on the client network by setting the --client-network-ip option, and you do not specify one of the TLS options, vic-machine create uses this address as the Common Name with which to auto-generate trusted CA certificates. If you do not specify --tls-cname, --no-tls or --no-tlsverify, two-way TLS authentication with trusted certificates is implemented by default when you deploy the VCH with a static IP address on the client network. If you assign a static IP address to the endpoint VM on the client network, vic-machine create creates the same certificate and environment variable files as described in the --tls-cname option.\nIMPORTANT: If the client network shares a port group with the public network you cannot set a static IP address for the endpoint VM on the client network. To assign a static IP address to the endpoint VM you must set a static IP address on the public network by using the --public-network-ip option. In this case, vic-machine create uses the public network IP address as the Common Name with which to auto-generate trusted CA certificates, in the same way as it would for the client network.\n\nIf you do not specify an IP address for the endpoint VM on a given network, vic-machine create uses DHCP to obtain an IP address for the endpoint VM on that network.\n\n\nYou specify addresses as IPv4 addresses with a network mask.\n--public-network-ip 192.168.X.N/24\n--management-network-ip 192.168.Y.N/24\n--client-network-ip 192.168.Z.N/24\n\n\nYou can also specify addresses as resolvable FQDNs.\n--public-network-ip=vch27-team-a.internal.domain.com\n--management-network-ip=vch27-team-b.internal.domain.com\n--client-network-ip=vch27-team-c.internal.domain.com\n\n\n--client-network-gateway, --public-network-gateway, --management-network-gateway\nShort name: None\nThe gateway to use if you use --public/client/management-network-ip to specify a static IP address for the VCH endpoint VM on the public, client, or management networks. If you specify a static IP address on the public network, you must specify a gateway by using the --public-network-gateway option. If the management and client networks are L2 adjacent to their gateways, you do not need to specify the gateway for those networks.\nYou specify gateway addresses as IP addresses without a network mask.\n--public-network-gateway 192.168.X.1\n\nThe default route for the VCH endpoint VM is always on the public network. As a consequence, if you specify a static IP address on either of the management or client networks and those networks are not L2 adjacent to their gateways, you must specify the routing destination for those networks in the --management-network-gateway and --client-network-gateway options. You specify the routing destination or destinations in a comma-separated list, with the address of the gateway separated from the routing destinations by a colon (:).\n--management-network-gateway routing_destination_1,\nrouting_destination_2:gateway_address\n--client-network-gateway routing_destination_1,\nrouting_destination_2:gateway_address\n\nIn the following example, --management-network-gateway informs the VCH that it can reach all of the vSphere management endoints that are in the ranges 192.168.3.0-255 and 192.168.128.0-192.168.131.255 by sending packets to the gateway at 192.168.2.1. Ensure that the address ranges that you specify include all of the systems that will connect to this VCH instance. \n--management-network-gateway 192.168.3.0,192.168.128.0:192.168.2.1\n\n\n\nOptions for Configuring a Non-DHCP Network for Container Traffic \nIf the network that you specify in the container-network option does not support DHCP, you must specify the container-network-gateway option. You can optionally specify one or more DNS servers and a range of IP addresses for container VMs on the container network. \nFor information about the container network, see the section on the container-network option.\n--container-network-gateway\nShort name: --cng\nThe gateway for the subnet of the container network. This option is required if the network that you specify in the --container-network option does not support DHCP. Specify the gateway in the format container_network:subnet. If you specify this option, it is recommended that you also specify the  --container-network-dns option.\nWhen you specify the container network gateway, you must use the port group that you specify in the --container-network option. If you specify --container-network-gateway but you do not specify --container-network, or if you specify a different port group to the one that you specify in --container-network, vic-machine create fails with an error.\n--container-network-gateway port_group_name:gateway_ip_address/subnet_mask\n\nWrap the port group name in single quotes (Linux or Mac OS) or double quotes (Windows) if it includes spaces.\n--container-network-gateway 'port group name':gateway_ip_address/subnet_mask\n\n--container-network-dns\nShort name: --cnd\nThe address of the DNS server for the container network. This option is recommended if the network that you specify in the --container-network option does not support DHCP. \nWhen you specify the container network DNS server, you must use the  port group that you specify in the --container-network option. You can specify --container-network-dns multiple times, to configure multiple DNS servers. If you specify --container-network-dns but you do not specify --container-network, or if you specify a different port group to the one that you specify in --container-network, vic-machine create fails with an error.\n--container-network-dns port_group_name:8.8.8.8\n\nWrap the port group name in single quotes (Linux or Mac OS) or double quotes (Windows) if it includes spaces.\n--container-network-dns 'port group name':8.8.8.8\n\n--container-network-ip-range\nShort name: --cnr\nThe range of IP addresses that container VMs can use if the network that you specify in the container-network option does not support DHCP. If you specify --container-network-ip-range, VCHs manage the addresses for containers within that range. The range that you specify must not be used by other computers or VMs on the network. If you specify container-network-gateway but do not specify --container-network-ip-range, the IP range for container VMs is the entire subnet that you specify in --container-network-gateway. \nWhen you specify the container network IP range, you must use the port group that you specify in the --container-networkoption. If you specify --container-network-ip-range but you do not specify --container-network, or if you specify a different port group to the one that you specify in --container-network, vic-machine create fails with an error.\n--container-network-ip-range port_group_name:192.168.100.2-192.168.100.254\n\nYou can also specify the IP range as a CIDR.\n--container-network-ip-range port_group_name:192.168.100.0/24\n\nWrap the port group name in single quotes (Linux or Mac OS) or double quotes (Windows) if it includes spaces.\n--container-network-ip-range 'port group name':192.168.100.0/24\n\n\nOptions to Configure VCHs to Use Proxy Servers \nIf access to the Internet or to your private image registries requires the use of a proxy server, you must configure a VCH to connect to the proxy server when you deploy it. The proxy is used only when pulling images, and not for any other purpose.\nIMPORTANT: Configuring a VCH to use a proxy server does not configure proxy support on the containers that this VCH runs. Container developers must configure proxy servers on containers when they create them. \n--https-proxy\nShort name: --sproxy\nThe address of the HTTPS proxy server through which the VCH accesses image registries when using HTTPS. Specify the address of the proxy server as either an FQDN or an IP address.\n--https-proxy https://proxy_server_address:port\n\n--http-proxy\nShort name: --hproxy\nThe address of the HTTP proxy server through which the VCH accesses image registries when using HTTP. Specify the address of the proxy server as either an FQDN or an IP address.\n--http-proxy http://proxy_server_address:port\n\n\nAdvanced Resource Management Options \nYou can set limits on the memory and CPU shares and reservations on the VCH. For information about memory and CPU shares and reservations, see Allocate Memory Resources, and Allocate CPU Resources in the vSphere documentation.\n--memory-reservation\nShort name: --memr\nReserve a quantity of memory for use by the VCH vApp in vCenter Server, or for the VCH resource pool on an ESXi host. This limit also applies to the container VMs that run in the VCH vApp or resource pool. Specify the memory reservation value in MB. If not specified, vic-machine create sets the reservation to 1.\n--memory-reservation 1024\n\n--memory-shares\nShort name: --mems\nSet memory shares on the VCH vApp in vCenter Server, or on the VCH resource pool on an ESXi host.  This limit also applies to the container VMs that run in the VCH vApp or resource pool. Specify the share value as a level or a number, for example high, normal, low, or 163840. If not specified, vic-machine create sets the share to normal.\n--memory-shares low\n\n--cpu-reservation\nShort name: --cpur\nReserve a quantity of CPU capacity for use by the VCH vApp in vCenter Server, or for the VCH resource pool on an ESXi host. This limit also applies to the container VMs that run in the VCH vApp or resource pool.  Specify the CPU reservation value in MHz. If not specified, vic-machine create sets the reservation to 1.\n--cpu-reservation 1024\n\n--cpu-shares\nShort name: --cpus\nSet CPU shares on the VCH vApp in vCenter Server, or on the VCH resource pool on an ESXi host.  This limit also applies to the container VMs that run in the VCH vApp or resource pool. Specify the share value as a level or a number, for example high, normal, low, or 163840. If not specified, vic-machine create sets the share to normal.\n--cpu-shares low\n\n--endpoint-cpu\nShort name: none\nThe number of virtual CPUs for the VCH endpoint VM. The default is 1. Set this option to increase the number of CPUs in the VCH endpoint VM.\nNOTE Always use the --cpu option instead of the --endpoint-cpu option to increase the overall CPU capacity of the VCH vApp, rather than increasing the number of CPUs on the VCH endpoint VM. The --endpoint-cpu option is mainly intended for use by VMware Support.\n--endpoint-cpu number_of_CPUs\n\n--endpoint-memory\nShort name: none\nThe amount of memory for the VCH endpoint VM. The default is 2048MB. Set this option to increase the amount of memory in the VCH endpoint VM if the VCH will pull large container images.\nNOTE With the exception of VCHs that pull large container images, always use the --memory option instead of the --endpoint-memory option to increase the overall amount of memory for the VCH vApp, rather than on the VCH endpoint VM. Use docker create -m to set the memory on container VMs. The --endpoint-memory option is mainly intended for use by VMware Support.\n--endpoint-memory amount_of_memory\n\n\nOther Advanced Options \n--bridge-network-range \nShort name: --bnr\nThe range of IP addresses that additional bridge networks can use when container application developers use docker network create to create new bridge networks. If you do not specify the bridge-network-range option, the IP range for bridge networks is 172.16.0.0/12.\nWhen you specify the bridge network IP range, you specify the IP range as a CIDR. The smallest subnet that you can specify is /16. If you specify an invalid value for --bridge-network-range, vic-machine create fails with an error.\n--bridge-network-range 192.168.100.0/16\n\n\n--base-image-size\nShort name: None\nThe size of the base image from which to create other images. You should not normally need to use this option. Specify the size in GB or MB. The default size is 8GB. Images are thin-provisioned, so they do not usually consume 8GB of space.  \n--base-image-size 4GB\n\n--container-store\nShort name: --cs\nThe container-store option is not enabled. Container VM files are stored in the datastore that you designate as the image store. \n--appliance-iso\nShort name: --ai\nThe path to the ISO image from which the VCH appliance boots. Set this option if you have moved the appliance.iso file to a folder that is not the folder that contains the vic-machine binary or is not the folder from which you are running vic-machine. Include the name of the ISO file in the path.\nNOTE: Do not use the --appliance-iso option to point vic-machine to an --appliance-iso file that is of a different version to the version of vic-machine that you are running.\n--appliance-iso path_to_ISO_file/appliance.iso\n\nWrap the folder names in the path in single quotes (Linux or Mac OS) or double quotes (Windows) if they include spaces.\n--appliance-iso 'path to ISO file'/appliance.iso\n\n--bootstrap-iso\nShort name: --bi\nThe path to the ISO image from which to boot container VMs. Set this option if you have moved the bootstrap.iso file to a folder that is not the folder that contains the vic-machine binary or is not the folder from which you are running vic-machine. Include the name of the ISO file in the path.\nNOTE: Do not use the --bootstrap-iso option to point vic-machine to a --bootstrap-iso file that is of a different version to the version of vic-machine that you are running.\n--bootstrap-iso path_to_ISO_file/bootstrap.iso\n\nWrap the folder names in the path in single quotes (Linux or Mac OS) or double quotes (Windows) if they include spaces.\n--bootstrap-iso 'path to ISO file'/bootstrap.iso\n\n--use-rp\nShort name: none\nDeploy the VCH appliance to a resource pool on vCenter Server rather than to a vApp. If you specify this option, vic-machine create creates a resource pool with the same name as the VCH.\n--use-rp\n\n\n--debug \nShort name: -v\nDeploy the VCH with a more verbose level of logging, for troubleshooting purposes. Specifying the --debug option increases the verbosity of the logging for all aspects of VCH operation, not just deployment. For example, by setting --debug, you increase the verbosity of the logging for VCH initialization, VCH services, container VM initialization, and so on. If not specified, the debug value is set to 0 and verbose logging is disabled. Provide a value of 1 or greater to increase the verbosity of the logging. Note that setting debug to a value greater than 1 can affect the behavior of vic-machine create. For example, setting --debug to 3 suppresses the restart of failed components.\nAdditionally, deploying a VCH with a debug value of 3 or higher enables access to the VCH endpoint VM console by default, with a root password of password. This functionality enables you to perform targeted interactive diagnostics in environments in which a VCH endpoint VM failure occurs consistently and in a fashion that prevents vic-machine debug from functioning. \nIMPORTANT: There is no provision for persistently changing the default root password.

For information about how to create a distributed virtual switch and port group, see the section on vCenter Server Network Requirements in Environment Prerequisites for VCH Deployment.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nProvides the vCenter Single Sign-On user and password in the --target option. Note that the user name is wrapped in quotes, because it contains the @ character. Use single quotes if you are using vic-machine on a Linux or Mac OS system and double quotes on a Windows system. \nDeploys a VCH named vch1 to the cluster cluster1 in datacenter dc1. \nUses a port group named vic-bridge for the bridge network. \nDesignates datastore1 as the datastore in which to store container images, the files for the VCH appliance, and container VMs. \n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--name vch1\n--force\n--no-tlsverify\n\n\n\nDeploy to a Specific Standalone Host in vCenter Server \nIf vCenter Server manages multiple standalone ESXi hosts that are not part of a cluster, you use the --compute-resource option to specify the address of the ESXi host to which to deploy the VCH.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, image store, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nDeploys the VCH on the ESXi host with the FQDN esxihost1.organization.company.com in the datacenter dc1.

Any container VM traffic that routes through the VCH also uses the public network. If you do not specify the --public-network option, the VCH uses the VM Network for public network traffic.\nYou can direct traffic between ESXi hosts, vCenter Server, and the VCH to a specific network by specifying the --management-network option. If you do not specify the --management-network option, the VCH uses the public network for management traffic.\nYou can designate a specific network for use by the Docker API by specifying the --client-network option. If you do not specify the --client-network option, the Docker API uses the public network.\n\nIMPORTANT: A VCH supports a maximum of 3 distinct network interfaces. Because the bridge network requires its own port group, at least two of the public, client, and management networks must share a network interface and therefore a port group. Container networks do not go through the VCH, so they are not subject to this limitation. This limitation will be removed in a future release.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, datacenter, cluster, image store, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nDirects public and management traffic to network 1 and Docker API traffic to network 2. Note that the network names are wrapped in quotes, because they contain spaces. Use single quotes if you are using vic-machine on a Linux or Mac OS system and double quotes on a Windows system.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--public-network 'network 1'\n--management-network 'network 1'\n--client-network 'network 2'\n--name vch1\n--force\n--no-tlsverify\n\n\nFor more information about the networking options, see the Networking Options section in VCH Deployment Options.\nSet a Static IP Address for the VCH Endpoint VM on the Different Networks \nIf you specify networks for any or all of the public, management, and client networks, you can deploy the VCH so that the VCH endpoint VM has a static IP address on one or more of those networks.  \nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, datacenter, cluster, image store, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nDirects public and management traffic to network 1 and Docker API traffic to network 2. Note that the network names are wrapped in quotes, because they contain spaces. Use single quotes if you are using vic-machine on a Linux or Mac OS system and double quotes on a Windows system.\nSets a DNS server for use by the public, management, and client networks.\nSets a static IP address and subnet mask for the VCH endpoint VM on the public and client networks. Because the management network shares a network with the public network, you only need to specify the public network IP address. You cannot specify a management IP address because you are sharing a port group between the management and public network.\nSpecifies the gateway for the public network. If you set a static IP address on the public network, you must also specify the gateway address.\nDoes not specify a gateway for the client network. It is not necessary to specify a gateway on either of the client or management networks if those networks are L2 adjacent to their gateways.\nBecause this example specifies a static IP address for the VCH endpoint VM on the client network, vic-machine create uses this address as the Common Name with which to create auto-generated trusted certificates. Full TLS authentication is implemented by default, so no TLS options are specified. \n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--public-network 'network 1'\n--public-network-ip 192.168.1.10/24\n--public-network-gateway 192.168.1.1\n--management-network 'network 1'\n--client-network 'network 2'\n--client-network-ip 192.168.3.10/24\n--dns-server dns_server_address\n--force\n--name vch1\n\n\nFor more information about setting static IP addresses, see the Options for Specifying a Static IP Address for the VCH Endpoint VM in VCH Deployment Options.\nConfigure a Non-DHCP Network for Container VMs \nYou can designate a specific network for container VMs to use by specifying the --container-network option. Containers use this network if the container developer runs docker run or docker create specifying the --net option with one of the specified container networks when they run or create a container. This option requires a port group that must exist before you run vic-machine create. You cannot use the same port group that you use for the bridge network. You can provide a descriptive name for the network, for use by Docker. If you do not specify a descriptive name, Docker uses the vSphere network name. For example, the descriptive name appears as an available network in the output of docker info and docker network ls. \nIf the network that you designate as the container network in the --container-network option does not support DHCP, you can configure the gateway, DNS server, and a range of IP addresses for container VMs to use. \nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, datacenter, cluster, image store, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nUses the VM Network for the public, management, and client networks.\nDesignates a port group named vic-containers for use by container VMs that are run with the --net option.\nGives the container network the name vic-container-network, for use by Docker. \nSpecifies the gateway, two DNS servers, and a range of IP addresses on the container network for container VMs to use.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--container-network vic-containers:vic-container-network\n--container-network-gateway vic-containers:gateway_ip_address/24\n--container-network-dns vic-containers:dns1_ip_address\n--container-network-dns vic-containers:dns2_ip_address\n--container-network-ip-range vic-containers:192.168.100.0/24\n--name vch1\n--force\n--no-tlsverify\n\n\nFor more information about the container network options, see the --container-network and Options for Configuring a Non-DHCP Network for Container Traffic sections in VCH Deployment Options.\nConfigure a Proxy Server \nIf your network access is controlled by a proxy server, you must   configure a VCH to connect to the proxy server when you deploy it, so that it can pull images from external sources.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, image store, cluster, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nConfigures the VCH to access the network via an HTTPS proxy server.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--https-proxy https://proxy_server_address:port\n--name vch1\n--force\n--no-tlsverify\n\n\n\n\nSpecify Volume Stores \nIf container application developers will use the docker volume create command to create containers that use volumes, you must create volume stores when you deploy VCHs. You specify volume stores in the --volume-store option. You can specify --volume-store multiple times to create multiple volume stores. \nWhen you create a volume store, you specify the name of the datastore to use and an optional path to a folder on that datastore. You also specify a descriptive name for that volume store for use by Docker.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, datacenter, cluster, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nSpecifies the volumes folder on datastore 1 as the default volume store. Creating a volume store named default allows container application developers to create anonymous or named volumes by using docker create -v. \nSpecifies a second volume store named volume_store_2 in the volumes folder on datastore 2. \nNote that the datastore names are wrapped in quotes, because they contain spaces. Use single quotes if you are using vic-machine on a Linux or Mac OS system and double quotes on a Windows system.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--image-store 'datastore 1'\n--volume-store 'datastore 1'/volumes:default\n--volume-store 'datastore 2'/volumes:volume_store_2\n--name vch1\n--force\n--no-tlsverify\n\n\nFor more information about volume stores, see the volume-store section in VCH Deployment Options. \nSecurity Examples \nThe examples in this section demonstrate how to configure a VCH to use Certificate Authority (CA) certificates to enable TLSVERIFY in your Docker environment, and to allow access to insecure registries of Docker images.\nUse Auto-Generated Trusted CA Certificates \nYou can deploy a VCH that implements two-way authentication with trusted auto-generated TLS certificates that are signed by a CA. \nTo automatically generate a server certificate that can pass client verification, you must specify the Common Name (CN) for the certificate by using the --tls-cname option. The CN should be the FQDN or IP address of the server, or a domain with a wildcard. The CN value must match the name or address that clients will use to connect to the server. You can use the --organization option to add basic descriptive information to the server certificate. This information is visible to clients if they inspect the server certificate.\nIf you specify an existing CA file with which to validate clients, you must also provide an existing server certificate that is compatible with the --tls-cname value or the IP address of the client interface.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user, password, datacenter, image store, cluster, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nProvides a wildcard domain *.example.org as the FQDN for the VCH, for use as the Common Name in the certificate. This assumes that there is a DHCP server offering IP addresses on VM Network, and that those addresses have corresponding DNS entries such as dhcp-a-b-c.example.com.\nSpecifies a folder in which to store the auto-generated certificates.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--tls-cname *.example.org\n--cert-path path_to_cert_folder\n--force\n--name vch1\n\n\nThe Docker API for this VCH will be accessible at https://dhcp-a-b-c.example.com:2376.\nFor more information about using auto-generated CA certificates, see the Security Options section in VCH Deployment Options.\nUse Custom Server Certificates \nYou can create a VCH that uses a custom server certificate, for example  a server certificate that has been signed by Verisign or another public root. You use the --cert and --key options to provide the paths to a custom X.509 certificate and its key when you deploy a VCH. The paths to the certificate and key files must be relative to the location from which you are running vic-machine create.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, image store, cluster, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nProvides the paths relative to the current location of the *.pem files for the custom server certificate and key files.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--cert ../some/relative/path/certificate_file.pem\n--key ../some/relative/path/key_file.pem\n--name vch1\n--force\n\n\nFor more information about using custom server certificates, see the Advanced Security Options section in VCH Deployment Options.\nSpecify Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation \nWhen you deploy a VCH, you can use different vSphere user accounts for deployment and for operation. This allows you to run VCHs with lower levels of privileges than are required for deployment.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the image store and name for the VCH.\nSpecifies vsphere_admin in the --target option, to identify the user account with vSphere Administrator privileges with which to deploy the VCH.\nSpecifies vsphere_user and its password in the --ops-user and --ops-password options, to identify the user account with which the VCH runs. The user account that you specify in --ops-user must  is different to the vSphere Administrator account that you use for deployment, and must exist before you deploy the VCH. \nSpecifies a resource pool in which to deploy the VCH in the --compute-resource option.\nSpecifies the full inventory paths to port groups in a network folder in the --bridge-network and --bridge-network options.\n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target vsphere_admin:vsphere_admin_password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1/VCH_pool\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network datacenter/network/network_folder/vch1-bridge\n--container-network datacenter/network/network_folder/vic-containers:vic-container-network\n--name vch1\n--ops-user vsphere_user\n--ops-password vsphere_user_password\n--force\n--no-tlsverify\n\n\nFor information about the permissions that the --ops-user account requires, and the permissions to set on the resource pool for the VCH and on the network folders, see Use Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation.\nAuthorize Access to an Insecure Private Registry Server \nTo authorize connections from a VCH to an insecure private registry server, set the insecure-registry option. You can specify insecure-registry multiple times to allow connections from the VCH to multiple insecure private registry servers.\nThis example deploys a VCH with the following configuration:\n\nSpecifies the user name, password, image store, cluster, bridge network, and name for the VCH.\nAuthorizes the VCH to pull Docker images from the insecure private registry servers located at the URLs registry_URL_1 and registry_URL_2.\nThe registry server at registry_URL_2 listens for connections on port 5000. \n\nvic-machine-operating_system create\n--target 'Administrator@vsphere.local':password@vcenter_server_address/dc1\n--compute-resource cluster1\n--image-store datastore1\n--bridge-network vch1-bridge\n--insecure-registry registry_URL_1\n--insecure-registry registry_URL_2:5000\n--name vch1\n--force\n--no-tlsverify\n\n\nFor more information about configuring VCHs to connect to insecure private registry servers, see the section on the insecure-registry option in VCH Deployment Options.\n"},"vic_vsphere_admin/set_up_ops_user.html":{"url":"vic_vsphere_admin/set_up_ops_user.html","title":"Use Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation","keywords":"","body":"Use Different User Accounts for VCH Deployment and Operation\nA virtual container host (VCH) appliance requires the appropriate permissions in vSphere to perform various tasks during VCH operation. \nDuring deployment of a VCH, vic-machine uses the vSphere account that you specify in either of the vic-machine create --user or --target options for all deployment operations. Deployment of a VCH requires a user account with vSphere Administrator privileges. \nDay-to-day operation of a VCH requires fewer permissions than  deployment. You can configure a VCH so that it uses different user accounts for deployment and for operation by using the vic-machine create --ops-user and --ops-password options when you deploy the VCH. By specifying --ops-user, you can limit the post-deployment permissions of the VCH to only those vSphere operations that it needs. If you do not specify --ops-user, the VCH runs with full vSphere Administrator privileges.\nAfter deployment, a VCH must have permission to perform the following operations:\n\nCreate, modify, and delete VMs within its resource pool\nReconfigure the endpoint VM\nValidate host firewall configuration and system licenses\n\nWhen you deploy a VCH, a user account that you specify in --ops-user must have the correct privileges to allow the VCH to perform these operations. vSphere Integrated Containers Engine does not currently create the required roles, so to assign privileges to the --ops-user user account, you must manually create user roles in vSphere before you deploy the VCH. You assign  privileges to those roles, and assign the roles to the user account to use in --ops-user. \nProcedure\n\nIn the vSphere Web Client, create a user group, for example VIC Ops Users, and add the appropriate user accounts to the user group.\nThe best practice when assigning roles in vSphere is to assign the roles to user groups and then to add users to those groups, rather than assigning roles to the users directly.\n\nGo to Administration > Roles and create one role for each type of inventory object that VCHs need to access.\nIt is possible to create a single role, but by creating multiple roles you keep the privileges of the VCH as granular as possible.\n\n\n\nRole to Create\nRequired Permissions\n\n\n\n\nVCH - vcenter\nDatastore > Configure datastore\n\n\nVCH - datacenter\nDatastore > Configure datastoreDatastore > Low level file operations\n\n\nVCH - datastore\nDatastore > AllocateSpaceDatastore > Browse datastore Datastore > Configure datastoreDatastore > Remove fileDatastore > Low level file operationsHost > Configuration > System management\n\n\nVCH - network\nNetwork > Assign network\n\n\nVCH - endpoint\ndvPort group > ModifydvPort group > Policy operationdvPort group > Scope operationvApp > Add virtual machineVirtualMachine > Configuration > Add new diskVirtualMachine > Configuration > AdvancedVirtualMachine > Configuration > Add or Remove DeviceVirtualMachine > Configuration > Remove diskVirtualMachine > Guest operations > Guest operation program executionVirtualMachine > Interaction > Device connectionVirtualMachine > Interaction > Power offVirtualMachine > Interaction > Power onVirtualMachine > Inventory > Create newVirtualMachine > Inventory > RemoveVirtualMachine > Inventory > RegisterVirtualMachine > Inventory > Unregister\n\n\nFor information about how to create vSphere roles, see vSphere Permissions and User Management Tasks in the vSphere documentation. \n\nGo to Networking, create a network folder, and place the distributed virtual switches that the VCHs will use for the bridge network and any container networks into that folder.\nThe parent object of distributed virtual switches that the VCH uses  as the bridge network and container networks must be set to Read-Only, with Propagate to Children enabled. By placing distributed virtual switches in a network folder, you avoid setting an entire datacenter to Read-Only. This restriction only applies to the bridge network and container networks. When you specify the vic-machine create --bridge-network and --container-network options, include the full inventory path to the networks in the following format:datacenter/network/network_folder/port_group_name\n\n(Optional) Go to Hosts and Clusters and create a resource pool in which to deploy VCHs.\nBy creating a resource pool for VCHs, you can set the correct permissions on just that resource pool rather than on an entire host or cluster. You specify this resource pool in the vic-machine create --compute-resource option when you deploy the VCH. For a more granular application of privileges, you can also apply the permissions directly to VCH vApps after deployment, rather than to a resource pool.\n\nIn each of the Hosts and Clusters, Storage, and Networking views, select inventory objects and assign the user group and the appropriate role to each one.\n\n\n\nInventory Object\nRole to Assign\nPropagate\n\n\n\n\nTop-level vCenter Server instance\nVCH - vcenter\nNo\n\n\nDatacenters\nVCH - datacenter\nNo\n\n\nClusters.

Ensure that the various vSphere inventory objects that you specify as arguments have the user group with the appropriate role.

Harbor requires 60GB or more free space on your datastore.\nIf no server certificate and private key are provided during installation, Harbor will create a self-generated CA (certificate authority) certificate, a server certificate, and a server private key.  The self-generated CA certificate will be available for download from the Harbor web client.\nSee the OVA installation guide for Harbor Harbor docs. Harbor requires both an IP address and FQDN (fully qualified domain name) for the server. A DHCP install method is available for debugging purposes, but it is not a recommended production deployment model.\nThis example assumes a Harbor instance was installed without a server certificate or a private key and the CA cert downloaded using the Harbor instructions. For Harbor to work with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine you need to update standard docker with the Harbor CA cert and deploy a new VCH with the CA cert.\nUpdate the User Working Machine's Standard Docker with the Harbor CA Certificate\nUpdate the machine with standard Docker so it recognizes the CA certificate. Docker can look for additional CA certificates outside of the operating system's CA bundle folder if the new CA certificates are in the correct location.

This is better for you because you do not have to worry about isolation, patching, security, backup, and so on. It is better for the vSphere administrator because every container that you deploy is a container VM, that they can manage just like all of their other VMs.\nIf you discover that you need more compute capacity, in Scenario 1, the vSphere administrator has to power down the VM and reconfigure it, or give you a new VM and let you deal with the clustering implications.

The IP address can either be static or be obtained from DHCP. As a container developer, you require the IP address of the VCH endpoint VM when you run Docker commands. \nDepending on the nature of your organization, you might deploy VCHs yourself, or you might request a VCH from a different person or team. If you do not run vic-machine create yourself, your organization must define the process by which you obtain VCH addresses. This process can be as simple as an exchange of emails with a vSphere administrator, or as advanced as a custom self-provisioning portal or API end-point. For example, your organization could use VMware vRealize® Automation™ to provide a self-provisioning service, by using the vRealize Automation interface or APIs to request VCHs. At the end of the provisioning process, vRealize Automation would communicate the VCH endpoint VM address to you.\nUsing Docker Environment Variables\nIf you or the vSphere administrator deploy VCHs with TLS authentication, vic-machine create generates a file named vch_address.env. The env file contains Docker environment variables that are specific to the VCH. You can use the contents of the env file to set environment variables in your Docker client. A self-provisioning service such as vRealize Automation could potentially provide the env file at the end of the provisioning process for VCHs.\nConnecting to the VCH\nHow you connect to your VCH depends on the security options with which  you or the vSphere administrator deployed the VCH. \n\nIf the VCH uses TLS authentication, either by using server certificates or by using mutual authentication with client and server certificates, you connect to the VCH at vch_address:2376.  \nIf the VCH uses mutual authentication with client and server certificates, you must configure the Docker client appropriately with one of the following options:\nBy using the following --tlsverify, --tlscert, and --tlskey Docker options, adding tlscacert if a custom CA was used to sign the server certificate.\nBy setting DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/path/to/client/cert.pem and DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1.\n\n\nIf the VCH uses server certificates without client authentication, you run Docker commands with the --tls option. The DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY environment variable must not be set. Note that setting DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY to 0 or false has no effect. \nIf TLS is completely disabled on the VCH, you connect to the VCH at vch_address:2375 and do not need to specify any additional Docker options. \n\n"},"vic_app_dev/using_volumes_with_vic.html":{"url":"vic_app_dev/using_volumes_with_vic.html","title":"Using Volumes with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine","keywords":"","body":"Using Volumes with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine supports the use of container volumes. \nIMPORTANT: To use container volume capabilities with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine, you or the vSphere administrator must configure the virtual container host (VCH) appropriately at the moment of deployment of the VCH. When you create or the vSphere administrator creates a VCH, you or the administrator must specify the datastore to use to store container volumes in the vic-machine create --volume-store option.

If you do not specify --name, docker volume create assigns a random UUID to the volume.\n\nIf you or the vSphere administrator created the VCH with one or more volume stores, but none of the volume stores are named default, you must specify the name of an existing volume store in the --opt VolumeStore option. If you do not specify --opt VolumeStore, docker volume create searches for a volume store named default, and returns an error if no such volume store exists. \ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls volume create \n--opt VolumeStore=volume_store_label \n--name volume_name\n\nIf you or the vSphere administrator created the VCH with a volume store named default, you do not need to specify --opt VolumeStore in the docker volume create command. If you do not specify a volume store name, the docker volume create command automatically uses the default volume store if it exists.\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls volume create \n--name volume_name\n\nYou can optionally set the capacity of a volume by specifying the --opt Capacity option when you run docker volume create. If you do not specify the --opt Capacity option, the volume is created with the default capacity of 1024MB. \nIf you do not specify a unit for the capacity, the default unit will be in Megabytes.\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls volume create \n--opt VolumeStore=volume_store_label \n--opt Capacity=2048\n--name volume_name\nTo create a volume with a capacity in megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes, include MB, GB, or TB in the value that you pass to --opt Capacity. The unit is case insensitive.\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls volume create \n--opt VolumeStore=volume_store_label \n--opt Capacity=10GB\n--name volume_name\n\n\n\nAfter you create a volume by using docker volume create, you can mount that volume in a container by running either of the following commands:\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \ncreate -v volume_name:/folder busybox\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \nrun -v volume_name:/folder busybox\n\nIn the examples above, Docker mounts the volume volume_name to /folder in the container.\nNOTE: When using a vSphere Integrated Containers Engine VCH as your Docker endpoint, the storage driver is always the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Backend Engine. If you specify the docker volume create --driver option an error stating that a bad driver has been selected will occur.\nCreating Volumes from Images \nSome images, for example, mongo or redis:alpine, contain volume bind information in their metadata. vSphere Integrated Containers Engine creates such volumes with the default parameters and treats them as anonymous volumes. vSphere Integrated Containers Engine treats all volume mount paths as unique, in the same way that Docker does. This should be kept in mind if you attempt to bind other volumes to the same location as anonymous or image volumes. A specified volume always takes priority over an anonymous volume.\nIf you require an image volume with a different volume capacity to the default, create a named volume with the required capacity. You can mount that named volume to the location that the image metadata specifies. You can find the location by running docker inspect image_name and consulting the Volumes section of the output. The resulting container has the required storage capacity and the endpoint.  \nCreate a Container with a New Anonymous or Named Volume \nIf you intend to create named or anonymous volumes by using docker create -v when creating containers, a volume store named default must exist in the VCH. \nNOTES: \n\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine does not support mounting folders as data volumes. A command such as docker create -v /folder_name:/folder_name busybox is not supported.\nIf you use docker create -v to create containers and mount new volumes on them, vSphere Integrated Containers Engine only supports the -r and -rw options.\n\nCreate a Container with a New Anonymous Volume\nTo create an anonymous volume, you include the path to the destination at which you want to mount the anonymous volume in the docker create -v command. Docker creates the anonymous volume in the default volume store, if it exists. The VCH mounts the anonymous volume on the container.\nThe docker create -v example below performs the following actions:\n\nCreates a busybox container that uses an anonymous volume in the default volume store.\nMounts the volume to /volumes in the container.\n\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \ncreate -v /volumes busybox\n\nCreate a Container with a Named Volume\nTo create a container with a new named volume, you specify a volume name in the docker create -v command. When you create containers that with named volumes, the VCH checks whether the volume exists in the volume store, and if it does not, creates it. The VCH mounts the existing or new volume on the container.\nThe docker create -v example below performs the following actions:\n\nCreates a busybox container\nCreates volume named volume_1 in the default volume store.\nMounts the volume to the /volumes folder in the container.\n\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \ncreate -v volume_1:/volumes busybox\n\nMount an Existing Volume on a Container \nMounting existing volumes on containers is subject to the following limitations:\n\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine currently supports mounting a volume on only one container at a time. \nDocker does not support unmounting a volume from a container, whether that container is running or not. When you mount a volume on a container by using docker create -v,  that volume remains mounted on the container until you remove the container. When you have removed the container you can mount the volume onto a new container.\nIf you intend to create and mount a volume on one container, remove that container, and then mount the same volume on another container, use a named volume. It is possible to mount an anonymous volume on one container, remove that container, and then mount the anonymous volume on another container, but it is not recommended to do so.\n\nThe docker create -v example below performs the following operations:\n\nCreates a container named container1 from the busybox image.\nMounts the named volume volume1 to the myData folder on that container, starts the container, and attaches to it.\nAfter performing operations in volume1:/myData, stops and removes container1.\nCreates a container named container2 from the Ubuntu image.\nMounts volume1 to the myData folder on container2.\n\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \ncreate --name container1 -v volume1:/myData busybox\ndocker start container1\ndocker attach container1 \n\n[Perform container operations and detach]\n\ndocker stop container1 \ndocker rm container1\ndocker create -it --name container2 -v volume1:/myData ubuntu\ndocker start container2 \ndocker attach container2 \n\n[Perform container operations with the same volume that was \npreviously mounted to container1]\n\nObtain Information About a Volume \nTo get information about a volume, run docker volume inspect and specify the name of the volume.\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \nvolume inspect volume_name\n\nDelete a Named Volume from a Volume Store \nTo delete a volume, run docker volume rm and specify the name of the volume to delete. \ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \nvolume rm volume_name\n\nNOTE: vSphere Integrated Containers does not support running docker rm -v to remove volumes that are associated with a container.\n"},"vic_app_dev/using_registries_with_vic.html":{"url":"vic_app_dev/using_registries_with_vic.html","title":"Using Private Registry Servers with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine","keywords":"","body":"Using Private Registry Servers with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine\nIf your development environment includes private registry servers for container images, you or the vSphere administrator must correctly configure virtual container hosts (VCHs) to allow them to connect to the private registry servers.\nYou can use vSphere Integrated Containers Engine with either secure or insecure private registry servers.\nSecure Private Registry Servers\nIf the private registry server is configured with TLS, the VCH must be able to validate the registry's certificate. If the registry's server certificate was signed by a custom CA, you must provide that CA to the VCH by using the --registry-ca option. If the registry server has a certificate signed by a public CA then it should function without any additional configuration.\nFor information about how to configure a VCH to use private registry server CA certificates, see the section on --registry-ca in VCH Deployment Options in vSphere Integrated Containers for vSphere Administrators. \nInsecure Private Registry Servers\nIf you set up a private registry that does not use certificates, you or the vSphere administrator must deploy the VCH with the vic-machine create --insecure-registry option. Setting the insecure-registry option on a VCH informs that VCH that it is authorized to pull images from the designated insecure private registry server.\nIf you authorize a VCH to connect to an insecure private registry server, the VCH attempts to access the registry server via HTTP if access via HTTPS fails. VCHs always use HTTPS when connecting to registry servers for which you have not authorized insecure access. Insecure private registries are not recommended in production environments.\nFor information about how to use the vic-machine create --insecure-registry option, see the section on insecure-registry in VCH Deployment Options in vSphere Integrated Containers for vSphere Administrators. \nPull a Container Image from a Private Registry Server\nTo pull a container image from a private registry server, run the following Docker command. \ndocker -H vch_address:2376 --tls \npull registry_server_address/path/to/image/image_name:image_version\n\nIf the private registry server listens for connections on a specific port, include the port number in the registry server URL.\ndocker -H vch_address:2376 --tls \npull registry_server_address:port_number/path/to/image/image_name:image_version\n\nThese commands will only work in the following circumstances:\n\nThe private registry server at registry_server_address is secured by CA certificates, and you or the vSphere administrator passed the appropriate certificates to the VCH during deployment by using the --registry-ca option.\nThe private registry server at registry_server_address is not secured by certificates, and you or the vSphere administrator authorized access to this registry server by using the --insecure-registry option during VCH deployment.\n\nNOTE: In the examples, the Docker commands specify --tls. This is to specify that the connection between the Docker client and the VCH is secured by TLS. The level of security of the connection between the Docker client and the VCH is completely independent from the level of security of the connection between the VCH and the private registry server. The connection to the private registry server can be insecure when the connection between the client and the VCH is secure, and the reverse.\n"},"vic_app_dev/using_vic_with_harbor.html":{"url":"vic_app_dev/using_vic_with_harbor.html","title":"Using vSphere Integrated Containers Engine with vSphere Integrated Containers Registry (Harbor)","keywords":"","body":"Using vSphere Integrated Containers Engine with vSphere Integrated Containers Registry (Harbor)\nThis example illustrates using a deployed Virtual Container Host (VCH) with Harbor as a private registry with the assumption that a VCH has been set up using either static IP or FQDN.

It does not describe the general function or makeup of the voting app.  \nGetting Started\n\nClone the Docker voting app repository from https://github.com/docker/example-voting-app.\nOpen the YML file for the simple Docker voting app, docker-compose-simple.yml.\n\n\nversion: \"2\"\n\nservices:\n  vote:\n    build: ./vote\n    command: python app.py\n    volumes:\n     - ./vote:/app\n    ports:\n      - \"5000:80\"\n\n  redis:\n    image: redis:alpine\n    ports: [\"6379\"]\n\n  worker:\n    build: ./worker\n\n  db:\n    image: postgres:9.4\n\n  result:\n    build: ./result\n    command: nodemon --debug server.js\n    volumes:\n      - ./result:/app\n    ports:\n      - \"5001:80\"\n      - \"5858:5858\"\n\n\nThis compose file uses two features that this version of vSphere Integrated Containers does not support:\n\nThe docker build command\nMapping of local folders to container volumes \n\nTo allow the voting app to work with vSphere Integrated Containers, you must modify it to work around these constraints. \nModify the Application\nThis version of vSphere Integrated Containers Engine does not support the docker build, tag, push commands. Use regular Docker without vSphere Integrated Containers Engine to perform the steps in this section.\nNOTE: It is possible to build and tag an image in one step. In this example, building and tagging are in separate steps.\n\nBuild images for the different components of the application.\ncd example-voting-app  \ndocker build -t vote ./vote  \ndocker build -t vote-worker ./worker  \ndocker build -t vote-result ./result\n\nTag the the images to upload them to your private registry or to your personal account on Docker Hub. \nThis example uses a Docker Hub account. Replace dockerhub_username with your own account name in the commands below.\ndocker tag vote dockerhub_username/vote  \ndocker tag vote-worker dockerhub_username/vote-worker  \ndocker tag vote-result dockerhub_username/vote-result\n\nPush the images to the registry.\ndocker login \n[Provide credentials] \ndocker push dockerhub_username/vote  \ndocker push dockerhub_username/vote-worker  \ndocker push dockerhub_username/vote-result \n\nOpen the docker-compose-simple.yml file in an editor and modify it to remove the operations that vSphere Integrated Containers does not support.\n\nRemove local folder mapping\nRemove all of the build directives\nUpdate dockerhub_username to your Docker Hub account name\nSave the modified file with the name docker-compose.yml.  \n\n\n\nThe example below shows the YML file after the modifications:\n\nversion: \"2\"\n\nservices:\n  vote:\n    image: dockerhub_username/vote\n    command: python app.py\n    ports:\n      - \"5000:80\"\n\n  redis:\n    image: redis:alpine\n    ports: [\"6379\"]\n\n  worker:\n    image: dockerhub_username/vote-worker\n\n  db:\n    image: postgres:9.4\n\n  result:\n    image: dockerhub_username/vote-result\n    command: nodemon --debug server.js\n    ports:\n      - \"5001:80\"\n      - \"5858:5858\"\n\n\nYou can download the modified YML file from the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine repository on Github from https://github.com/vmware/vic/blob/master/demos/compose/voting-app. \nDeploy the Application to a VCH\nThe steps in this section make the following assumptions:\n\nYou have deployed a virtual container host (VCH).\nYou deployed the VCH with a volume store named default by specifying  --volume-store datastore_name/path:default.\nYou deployed the VCH with the --no-tls option, to disable TLS authentication between the Docker client and the VCH.\nYou are using Docker Compose 1.8.1.\n\nIn the procedure below, run the commands from the example-voting-app  folder that contains the modified docker-compose.yml file.\n\nRun the docker-compose command.\n docker-compose -H vch_address:2375 up -d\n\nIn a browser, go to http://*vch_address*:5000 and http://*vch_address*:5001 to verify that the Docker voting application is running.\nYou can vote on port 5000 and see the results on port 5001.\n\n\n"},"vic_app_dev/ts_volume_store_error.html":{"url":"vic_app_dev/ts_volume_store_error.html","title":"Default Volume Store Error","keywords":"","body":"Default Volume Store Error\nWhen you create or run a container, the Docker operation fails with an error about a missing volume store.  \nProblem\nRunning the container fails with error:\ndocker: Error response from daemon: No volume store named (default) exists.\nCause\nBy default, vic-machine create does not create a volume store when you or the vSphere administrator deploy a VCH.
