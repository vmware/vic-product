# Introduction

 

This blog covers VIC 1.2.1 Installation for lab or production environment.

Following aspects of the installation will be detailed in this tutorial:

* VIC – Product versions & Pre-Requisites
* VIC - Deployment Options
* VIC – Installation and Consumption
* Install VIC VM (by deploying VIC OVA)
* Provision a VCH Instance
* Delete a VCH Instance

 

# Terminology


VIC uses several terminologies which are important to understand from the beginning.

VIC (vSphere Integrated Container) will be deployed as a VM from an OVA.

VIC VM will host essentials services like the Harbor private registry and Admiral container management.

VIC VM will host also the vic-machine utility that enables administrators to deploy VCH (Virtual Container Hosts).

VCH will be instantiated as a VM under an automatically created resource pool in the Compute cluster.

VCH behaves as a Docker endpoint where developer can target their system to in order to run Containers as VM (C-VM) on the ESXi cluster, up to the limit imposed by the resource pool.

Multiple VCH Instances can be deployed in the same vSphere environment.


# VIC – Product versions & Pre-Requisites

 

Product versions:

    ESXi: 6.0 or 6.5 (6.5 recommended)
    vCenter: 6.0 or 6.5 (6.5 recommended)
    VIC: 1.2.1

ESXi, vCenter and VIC are all available for download on vmware.com.

In term of storage, VIC can operate with any type of datastore: VMFS, shared storage like NFS or iSCSI and vSAN.

 

 

Environment Pre-Requisites:

    vSphere Enterprise Plus License
    User with administrative credentials to vCenter
    At least one Compute cluster with DRS enabled
    Internet Access for VCH to download images from Docker Hub
    Shared datastores to store VCH and containers (recommended minimum of 200Gb)
    Allow communication on port 443 and 2377 between VCH and ESXi hosts
    VCH needs to be reachable by Docker users for containers creation
    VIC VM needs to be reachable by any admin user who needs to download the vic-machine utility
    VIC VM needs to be reachable by Docker users for image upload and download (VIC VM hosts container registry)
    VIC VM needs to be reachable by VCH for container instantiation using a local image
    DVS switch with at least 2 Port Groups:
        1 for for public communication (VCH to external world)
        1 for for inter containers communication (recommended dedicated port group for each VCH)
        Note: If DHCP is not available on these segments, please, request a range of free IP Addresses.

 

DVS configuration used for this lab looks like this:
