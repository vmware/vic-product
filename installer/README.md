# VIC Unified Installer

This directory will host all the code that is going to be part of the VIC unified installer OVA.

It is currently under heavy development and not suitable for any use except for development, this file will be updated to reflect the status of the installer as development progresses.

## Usage

The build process (launched from your "build machine") uses Packer to launch a VM ("Packer VM") in
ESX, provision it with components, and snapshot it to make the OVA.

The Packer VM _MUST_ have a route to your build machine because the Packer VM boots from a
kickstart file served from the build machine. This means if the build machine and target ESX are run
in Fusion or Workstaion, both VMs should have either bridged or shared networking.

The build VM must have `ovftool` and if using `build.sh` must have `gsutil`.

Execute these commands on your ESX:
```
esxcli system settings advanced set -o /Net/GuestIPHack -i 1
esxcli network firewall set --enabled false
```

### Build bundle and OVA

#### Build script

The build script accepts files in `packer/scripts`, URLs, or revisions and automatically sets
required environment variables. `BUILD_VICENGINE_REVISION` is required for UI plugin even if using
file or URL.

Export required values
```
export PACKER_ESX_HOST=1.1.1.1
export PACKER_USER=root
export PACKER_PASSWORD=password
```

If called without any values, `build.sh` will get the latest build for each component
```
export BUILD_VICENGINE_REVISION=1.1.1
./scripts/build.sh
```

Build with files `packer/scripts/harbor.tgz` and `packer/scripts/vic.tar.gz` and Admiral tag
`vic_dev`.
```
export BUILD_VICENGINE_REVISION=1.1.1
./scripts/build.sh --harbor harbor.tgz --vicengine vic.tar.gz
```

Build with URLs, Admiral tag v1.1.1
```
export BUILD_VICENGINE_REVISION=1.1.1
./scripts/build.sh --admiral v1.1.1 --harbor https://example.com/harbor.tgz --vicengine https://example.com/vic.tar.gz
```

#### Manual

First, we have to set the revisions of the components we want to bundle in the OVA.
Specifying a file takes precedence, then URL, then revision.

```
export BUILD_VICENGINE_REVISION=1.1.1                      # Required (https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/vic-engine-releases)
                                                           # If specifying file or URL, REVISION is used for setting UI plugin version
export BUILD_VICENGINE_FILE=vic_10000.tar.gz               # Optional, file in `packer/scripts` export
export BUILD_VICENGINE_URL=https://example.com/vic.tar.gz  # Optional, URL to download

export BUILD_HARBOR_REVISION=v1.1.1                     # Optional, defaults to dev (https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/harbor-builds)
export BUILD_HARBOR_FILE=harbor-offline-installer.tgz   # Optional, file in `packer/scripts`
export BUILD_HARBOR_URL=https://example.com/harbor.tgz  # Optional, URL to download

export BUILD_ADMIRAL_REVISION=v1.1.1  # Optional, defaults to vic_dev tag (https://hub.docker.com/r/vmware/admiral/tags/)
```

Then set the required env vars for the build environment and make the release:

```
export PACKER_ESX_HOST=1.1.1.1
export PACKER_USER=root
export PACKER_PASSWORD=password
export BUILD_PORTGROUP="VM Network" # Port group that Packer VM is connected to, defaults to "VM Network" in `build.sh`
export PACKER_LOG=1                 # Optional

make ova-release
```

Deploy OVA with ovftool in a Docker container on ESX host
```
docker run -it --net=host -v ~/go/src/github.com/vmware/vic-product/installer/bin:/test-bin \
  gcr.io/eminent-nation-87317/vic-integration-test:1.34 ovftool --acceptAllEulas --X:injectOvfEnv \
  --X:enableHiddenProperties -st=OVA --powerOn --noSSLVerify=true -ds=datastore1 -dm=thin \
  --net:Network="VM Network" \
  --prop:appliance.root_pwd="password" \
  --prop:appliance.permit_root_login=True \
  --prop:management_portal.port=8282 \
  --prop:registry.port=443 \
  --prop:cluster_manager.admin="Administrator" \
  /test-bin/vic-a2f93359.ova \
  vi://root:password@192.168.1.86
```

## Vendor

To build the installer dependencies, ensure `GOPATH` is set, then issue the following.
``
$ make gvt vendor
``

This will install the [gvt](https://github.com/FiloSottile/gvt) utility and retrieve the build dependencies via `gvt restore`

#### No IP address ready

```

Solution: Disable firewall on the build machine and check networking. The Packer VM is unable to
get the kickstart file from your build machine.

```

Solution: If firewall is disabled already, set a reasonable timeout for VNC port connection `export PACKER_ESXI_VNC_PROBE_TIMEOUT=30s` or even longer.

#### Waiting for SSH

```
==> ova-release: Waiting for SSH to become available...
```

Look at the console for the launched `vic` Packer VM. The Packer VM might not be able to get the
kickstart file to boot.

Solution: Check networking. The Packer VM must have a route to the build machine. You may also need to disable the firewall on the build machine:
```
sudo ufw disable
```
